3804,582,"I learned in Canada square head screws are more common than the phillips head.

I have so many different types of phillips style bits. There are so many different types of phillips heads. If you use the wrong bit, either the bit or the screw gets damaged (or both). I don't think phillips head was made to be used with a drill. 

I've used the square bit for the past few months because some of my phillips head bits are damaged. I think I'm just gonna stick with the square bit for now on. I love the torque from the square. Also the square head seems to pair with the drill very well

Goodbye phillips head"

497,143,"This is a follow-up to [My previous submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/evafk/i_was_thinking_of_adding_a_section_for/) using a prior manifestation

1. It is possible that a maximally great being exists.

2. If it is possible that a maximally great being exists, then a maximally great being exists in some possible world.

3. If a maximally great being exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world.

4. If a maximally great being exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world.

5. If a maximally great being exists in the actual world, then a maximally great being exists.

6. Therefore, a maximally great being exists.

*First Flaw*: 1) is possibly flawed because of the omnipotence paradox, as follows

Omnipotence:

1. God is omnipotent 

2. If you are omnipotent you have all powers

3. An omnipotent being could not be limited in any way

4. Limiting things is a power.

5. An omnipotent being could not have the power to limit itself

6. It is logically impossible to be omnipotent

A Maximally Powerful (meaning capable of anything) being is not logically possible.

**Sidenote**: Usually 'Maximally Powerful' is used as opposed to omnipotence so as to establish a moving goal post of 'A manifestation without any logical paradox you can provide'

*Flaw 2*: The most critical flaw is that the possibility of existence does not mandate the necessity of existence.

It's possible that a universe exists in which there is a grilled cheese sandwich in the middle of the moon, this does not make that possible conception exist."

Also, how much smoke do you blow out from it? I only blowed a little, but I guess I suppose that's because it's just vapor and it's not as thick. 

Also, just on a side note, I'm kind of new with physically handling all the weed on my own (usually friends pack bowls etc.) so are the big stems on the very bottom usually the only stems people worry about when separating?

One more question- My grinder didn't grind it up fine enough so I had to crush it in my hands- it has to be reallyyyyy finely grained right??

I open it to find condensation inside!!! 2 of the recharbale batters were SO HOT LIKE ON FIRE. I dont know why!!! 1 was the battery i didn't even use!!! Isn't that freaky? was it because it was metal on metal??? wtf??? and the tops of the batteries are bURNT!!! Okay so what could this have been and should I toss those batteries out?

Are you piling up more student loan debt because of this and if so, do you regret it?

In the end, are you happy with your decision?

6224,495,"Event: 	Meet-up #1
Date: 	Saturday January 15th
Time: 	9:00PM
Location:	UCLA


Three sedditors met up at Westwood: cptncrnch, IncognitoL, and withClass. IncognitoL and I (withClass) are both 21 and learning about seduction and inner game. Cptncrnch is 23 and also pretty new. We decided to chill at  the UCLA café with some coffee and tea. 

To be frank, it's not every day any of us meet people from online; none of us had any idea how it was going to turn out. But IncognitoL and I knew each other already; it was cptncrnch who had the balls to drive here to meet 2 strangers. Upvotes for you man. I'm sure cptncrnch was crossing his fingers that we turn out to be normal.  I know I was. And thankfully, Will Rogers was right: we were just friends who haven't met yet.

Talking about a bunch of different topics, we realized that we had a lot in common: besides the fact that we're all Asian (2 Koreans and 1 Vietnamese), we've had similar experiences, such as romanticizing our previous relationships or not having really enjoyed the present. None of us are frequent bar goers (yet) or master PUAs. We're just your average keeping on track and prioritizing school. But the strongest connection is that we've all learned from our past: the mistakes we made, the fun we missed out on, and the life that we didn't live to the fullest. And we're on our way to take it the hell back. 

For me, as an example, despite the fact that I am a decent guy, I just never learned to value myself. Much like Neil, I used to be stuck on a defeatist mentalist: too short, too ineloquent, too Asian. After I suffered a cataclysm of negative changes and fell into the pit of post-breakup , I fell into a severe depression. But thanks to working out and seddit, I learned a lot of things about being a goddamn man and gained the confidence I needed to take control of my life. 

And for those who argue that sex with random girls is a waste of time, this isn't about that. This is about a group of guys wanting to improve ourselves, make new friends, and get to experience the world at its best by improving ourselves. It helped me talk to girls, but that's not the seddit in its entirety. It helped me talk to strangers and make friends. It helped me talk to my TAs and professors. It helped me break free from the shell in which I imprisoned myself and take the path to become the open, enthusiastic, and friendly person that I want to be.

I know there are more sedditors in LA...I mean come on this is f*cking LA. If you're living here or nearby, I really hope you let us know and get active. I want to make it clear: your looks, ethnicity, gender, and especially your PAST, and any other factors that might be holding you back...they don't matter at all. All that matters is that you want to improve yourself: whether it be by bettering your social skills, getting to make sedditor friends, building self-confidence, or really just picking up girls. And after all, to improve ourselves is why we're sedditors in the first place.

Also, I work night shift, so I'll be here for the next 4 hours... I'll be kinda busy most of tomorrow, and then if this is still active, by Friday night, I'll come back and answer anything else that pops up."
4524,714,"I'm a Patriots fan and have tickets to the divisional game, which I am attending with a friend.  But I also have tickets to the championship game in Foxborough, Mass providing the Patriots win.  The game is 1/23 at 6:30.

2513,624,"Help me Reddit, you're my only hope! This has been driving me nuts for YEARS.  There is a movie I watched as a kid that I'm trying to remember the name of.  I'm actually not sure if it really existed or my childhood memories are a little skewed.  This is what I have:  Mid 80s.  A young boy was the main character.  A mining company or some sort of big shots wanted to come to town and exploit them (in typical 80s fashion).  What really stood out about the movies is that during the movie the phrase ""danke schoen"" would echo through the boys mind.  Sometimes during these episodes, and sometimes not, the boy would dream/hallucinate about a giant crane underwater that someone stole/hid/lost...  The body of water was in a mining quarry. I think them finding the crane was somehow significant to the climax of the movie. So, reddit, that's about all I've got.  There will be a major award for the first person to figure this out seeing as how it's bothered me at least once a week for, let's say, 20 years or so... Probably one of my awesome paintings or something! 
Edit:  Pretty sure it was a family movie."

The best part here is, you could use the highlighting feature to flag mistakes, but instead of a highlight.. users who sign up to be proofreaders get an option to submit a correction.

* CPU: [AMD Phenom II X4 965 Black Edition](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103727) $160
i went with this one because it seemed to cover a good amount of the middle area of the Logical Increments guide.

* [ASUS M4A89GTD](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131631) $140
this one was a bit more expensive but it got really good reviews and i noted comments about it being easy to install and a good mobo for pc building beginners. the on board graphics with HDMI are also a plus since i dont have to get a graphics card right away.

* [COOLER MASTER Silent Pro M600 RS-600-AMBA-D3 600W](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817171036) $100
the key point for this PSU is that it is supposed to be very quiet which is very important to me as it will be right next to the tv. i doubt i would need 600w but i couldnt find a Silent Pro model for less than 600w.

* [G.SKILL Ripjaws Series 4GB (2 x 2GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1333](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231275) $50
i noted many people with the above mobo were using this ram and it got good reviews so i just went with it. some people had mentioned that if you OC the mobo one could get DDR3 2000 but that seems over my head at this point so i'll stick with 1333.

* [SAMSUNG Spinpoint F4 HD322GJ/U 320GB 7200 RPM 16MB Cache SATA 3.0Gb/s 3.5""](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822152244) $43
320gb is enough for this. i have a ton of external drives around the house that act as file servers.

* [ASUS Black 24X DVD+R](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827135204) $20
i have a ps3, i do not need a blu ray or blu ray burner at this point.

* [SILVERSTONE Black Aluminum / Steel LC10B-E ATX Media Center / HTPC Case](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811163118) $130
i posted a topic a while back about people's recommendations and someone loved this HTPC case and i looked into it and it looks pretty boss. seems pretty heavy duty with room for full ATX and micro ATX. and it doesnt look like a PC case. it may be a bit big but i feel this way i would be able to fit in a full size graphics card down the line.

* i will probably buy some replacement fans for the case if anyone knows of any quality fans that run quiet.

* i think a bit later i will be looking at a Radeon HD 5750 1 GB or GeForce GTS 450 since thats what the toms hardware graphics card buying guide suggests as the best ~$120 cards unless someone suggests otherwise for good reason.

Cheers!

so i got everything put together and double checked it all and plugged it in and went for power on and got leds on the mobo, fans spinning, HDD led blinking and everything seems to be good except no video signal (i'm using the onboard video). i checked a lot of the trouble shooting guides and it looks like it could be anything from bad mobo to bad onboard video to bad ram to bad PSU. but its hard because as of right now i dont have many back up components to swap out AND the case doesn't have a speaker so i cant hear any start up beeps.

i did track down an ancient pci vga graphics card and popped it in with no luck but im not sure if it was working to begin with.

it has a MEM OK! led that blinks red but eventually stops. so thats weird. if the memory is bad will the vga not work? if i take it out would there be a signal? it is rated good for that mobo though.. the package was a bit dinged up when i got it and one of the chips was a bit loose.

im going to try to see if anyone i know has spare parts i can mess with but my pickings will be slim.

3820,476,"I told them of the potential damage it could cause due to massive spam. I even explained how it was done. It is not really an exploit as much as it is a clever way of attaining information.

I can essentially be able to do this if some one visits a webpage I lead them to, and without getting verification from FB, use a workaround and get the person to post whatever I choose onto their wall for the next 30-60 days whenever I choose. 

Actually it is really clever and pride myself on the find since it doesn't involve anything I would consider ""exploitive"" rather than tricky.

Any hoo, how exactly can I get FB to become aware of this before some one else figures out how easy this trick is and becomes a serious problem. I was seriously able to pull it off in forums that allowed HTML. In one day I had access to 300 FB accounts I could do whatever I wanted with, w/o knowing their UN and PW's.

I was flipping my shit because there's no way I should fail that early.  Then I look at the weights I have on and think about it for a second.  I had put a 15 kg plate on instead of a 10.

1183,321,"Middle Tennessee (-2) vs. Miami (OH) - O/U 49
--------------------------

I see you guys like MTSU here, but I can't say I understand why. The Redhawk defense is stifling. The only teams who scored more than 21 points against Miami (OH) were Florida, Cincinnati, Missouri, and in-state rival Ohio (though that one seems more like a fluke than anything else). Meanwhile, Middle Tennessee barely scraped into a bowl playing in perhaps the weakest conference in the nation. 

Miami does the vast majority of its damage through the air, and MTSU has struggled against strong passing teams Troy (72.5%, 281 yds, 4 TDs, 0 INT) and Arkansas State (62.1%, 288 yds, 3 TDs, 1 INT). 

The Blue Raiders will try to attack on the ground...which is another problem, since the Redhawks are 21st in the nation against the run.

None of the numbers line up for MTSU, so I'm taking **Miami (OH) +2 (WINNER)**.

LSU (-2) vs. Texas A&amp;M - O/U 49
--------------------------

Initially, I assumed I'd be taking LSU in this one. In looking at the numbers, however, I find that the Tigers are a little overhyped on the defensive side of the ball. They rank only 31st against the run, specifically. Meanwhile the Aggies haven't gotten nearly *enough* credit for a defense that ranks *15th* against the run.

So both defenses are adequate, but A&amp;M's offense has come to life since the rise of Jr. QB Ryan Tannehill. Playing only half the season Tannehill has thrown for almost twice as many touchdowns as LSU's two QBs combined. He's also only turned it over three times, putting him in the top 40 QBs by passer rating. 

I look for the Aggies to scrape up a few more points than LSU. **Texas A&amp;M +2 (Loss)** is my play....I may even commit an r/sportsbook sin and bet UNDER 49...but no rec.

Not to be deterred by this (I still want to keep the gun after I get it. It's a pretty cool turn of the century revolver), I've decided that this will be the catalyst to get me into reloading.

&gt; Shoah (1985) reviewedBY ROGER EBERT / December 29, 2010

&gt; This film plays in two parts starting 12/31/2010 at the Siskel Center.

&gt; For more than nine hours I sat and watched a film named ""Shoah,"" and when it was over, I sat for a while longer and simply stared into space, trying to understand my emotions. I had seen a memory of the most debased chapter in human history. But I had also seen a film that affirmed life so passionately that I did not know where to turn with my confused feelings. There is no proper response to this film. It is an enormous fact, a 550-minute howl of pain and anger in the face of genocide. It is one of the noblest films ever made.

Also [the Wikipedia Entry](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Shoah_%28film%29)

Shoah, Claude Lanzmann’s 1985 film about the Holocaust, can now be seen on [YouTube, in 59 parts and lasting more than 9 hours](http://www.youtube.com/user/sternwolf27#g/c/674B1AF3DA9607CC).

145,568,"Ok I'm a fairly huge fan of the BSG universe but ""Sometimes a Great Notion"" is a lot for me to understand. Up to this point everything breaks down for me. This is what I am confused about:

* They say ""Earth"" was home to the 13th tribe. But the 13th tribe is cylon. Can someone explain to me how that entire scenario happened?!

* They found the remains of a HYBRID model, but Baltar and Saul claim it as cylon. The remains clearly had the centurian head but human bones.. I don't understand that anatomy and how it makes them cylon and not hybrid of any kind. 

* Tyrol touches the wall and has a flashback of the market on ""Earth"" but I thought the final 5 were sent to Caprica. Did they die at some point on Earth, resurrect, and then were banned to Caprica by Cavil?

* If Earth was home to the Cylons, and if Tyrol's flashback was on Earth.. Who did it and why was it bombed?

* Did they ever explain Starbuck's viper being here.. I don't mean that ""this has happened before"" cop out crap.. WHY did it happen before? That Starbuck moment was really odd and I understood hardly anything of it. Up to this point Leoben was understood to be God's messenger of sorts and he did not understand it either, Headsix danced around the subject (confirmed angel) so was starbuck really a work of god if his messengers didn't understand?

* Since Starbuck and the 4 had that ""feeling"" when they got twards Earth do you think Hera did too? Roslin, who has Hera's blood, had a headache or something back in Crossroads 1.  In this episode Hera is seen with an ominous stare while everyone else was excited.

* In one of the commentaries I thought RDM said All Along the Watchtower was played by someone in the fleet yet now we are to assume Anders played it also on Caprica?

Yes i know these are hardcore nerd questions and im likely looking too much into this. I might have some more Qs after this as I watch the last few episodes. Thanks.

*I've seen the entire series already during the original run."

3206,61,"My first day in Hell is drawing to a close. They don’t really have a sunset here, but the fires seem to dim a bit, and the screaming gets more subdued. Most of the demons are asleep now, their pointy tails curled up around them. They look so innocent, it’s hard to believe that just a few hours ago they were raping and torturing us.

The day started off at a party at the Chelsea Hotel, where some friends were daring me to do something. The next thing I knew, I was in Hell. At first, it seemed like a dream, but then I remembered that five-Martini dreams are usually a lot worse.

There’s a kind of customs station when you arrive here, where a skeleton in a black robe checks a big book to make sure your name’s there. And as he slowly scans the pages with his bony finger you can’t help thinking, Why does a skeleton need a robe? Especially since it’s so hot. That’s the first thing you notice about Hell, how hot it is. I know it’s a cliché, but it’s true. Fortunately, it’s a steamy, sulfury kind of hot. Like a spa or something.

You might think that people in Hell are all nude. But that’s a myth. You wear what you were last wearing on earth. For instance, I am dressed like the German U-boat captain in the movie “Das Boot,” because that’s what I wore to the party. It’s an easy costume, because all you really need is the hat. The bad part is, people are always asking you who you are, even in Hell. Come on! “Das Boot”!

The food here turns out to be surprisingly good. The trouble is, just about all of it is poisoned. So a few minutes after you finish eating you’re doubled over in agony. The weird thing is, as soon as you recover you’re ready to dig in all over again.

Despite the tasty food and warm weather, there’s a dark side to Hell. For one thing, it’s totally disorganized. That anything gets done down here is a miracle. You’ll be herded along in one big line, then it’ll separate into three lines, then the lines will all come back together again! For no apparent reason! It’s crazy. You try to ask a demon a question, but he just looks at you. I don’t mean to sound prejudiced, but you wonder if they even speak English.

To relieve the boredom, you can throw rocks at other people in line. They just think it was a demon. But I discovered the hard way that the demons don’t like it when they’re beating someone and you join in. 

It’s odd, but Hell can be a lonely place, even with so many people around. They all seem caught up in their own little worlds, running to and fro, wailing and tearing at their hair. You try to make conversation, but you can tell they’re not listening.

A malaise set in within a couple hours of my arriving. I thought getting a job might help. It turns out I have a lot of relatives in Hell, and, using connections, I became the assistant to a demon who pulls people’s teeth out. It wasn’t actually a job, more of an internship. But I was eager. And at first it was kind of interesting. After a while, though, you start asking yourself: Is this what I came to Hell for, to hand different kinds of pliers to a demon? I started wondering if I should even have come to Hell at all. Maybe I should have lived my life differently, and gone to Heaven instead.

I decided I had to get away—the endless lines, the senseless whipping, the forced sing-alongs. You get tired of trying to explain that you’ve already been branded, or that something that big won’t fit in your ear, even with a hammer. I wandered off. I needed some me time. I came to a cave and went inside. Maybe I would find a place to meditate, or some gold nuggets.

That’s when it happened, one of those moments which could only happen in Hell. I saw Satan. Some people have been in Hell for hundreds of years and have never seen Satan, but there he was: he was shorter than I thought he’d be, but he looked pretty good. He was standing on a big rock with his reading glasses on. I think he was practicing a speech. “Hey, Satan,” I yelled out, “how’s it going?” I was immediately set upon by demons. I can’t begin to describe the tortures they inflicted on me, because apparently they are trade secrets. Suffice it to say that, even as you endure all the pain, you find yourself thinking, Wow, how did they think of that?

My stitches are a little itchy, but at least the demons sewed most of my parts back on. More important, my faith in Hell as an exciting place where anything can happen has been restored.

I had better get some rest. They say the bees will be out soon and that it’s hard to sleep with the constant stinging. I lost my internship, but I was told I can reapply in a hundred years. Meanwhile, I’ve been assigned to a construction crew. Tomorrow we’re supposed to build a huge monolith, then take picks and shovels and tear it down, then beat each other to death. It sounds pointless to me, but what do I know. I’m new here."

631,85,"If God exists, then God is of infinite value, that is: God = ∞  ;    
If God does not exist, then God is of no value, that is: Atheism = 0  ;  

X is some finite value of your life, that is 0&lt;X&lt;∞, if you presume that every person has the potential to do something useful.  

Some intersting conclusions about life, if God is real:  

X + ∞ = ∞   (Adding God to your life is of infinite value)  
X - ∞ = - ∞ (Taking God away from your life is infinitely detrimental)  
X * ∞ = ∞ (God can multiply your potential to infinite possibilites)  
X / ∞ = 0 (Being divided by God reduces a person to no value)  

Some interesting conclusions about life, if there is no God:  

X + 0 = X (Atheism adds nothing to your life)  
X - 0 = X (Removing atheism does not reduce anyone's potential)  
X * 0 = 0 (Atheism multiplies our potential to become nothing)  
X / 0 = ?? (Being divided by atheism leaves us lost and undefined)

The conclusion is that atheism has no positive effects, while God has many powerful effects, some good and some bad.  If we allow ourselves to be divided by our belief in God or our belief that there is no God, then it is to our loss.  However, if we do not allow ourselves to be divided by our beliefs, then it is to our benefit.  The conlusion should be that tolerance yields the best result (I'm talking to you Christians).  

Also, if we do not see that each person has the potential to do some good, then the belief that God has empowered them is to our detriment.  The conclusion should be that every person has the potential to do something great, and that we should nurture that ability in every person we know (I'm talking you atheists and Christians).

3501,117,"currently i have a very rudimentary setup as far as scraping websites for content. i wrote a script using [Simple HTML DOM Parser](http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/).

The website it scrapes however changes their structure often and i need to make many minor edits. the only problem is i have to do this on every site we install the script on.

Is there a way i can ""include"" a php file from a separate server (our home server) so that any site that uses the file it pulls it from there?
I don't mind if the code is 'public' or anything.. all it is is a simple html scraping script. I know i cant use include statement but maybe i could have it in an html file or a txt file and then just import the text and run it as php?

im sure there are super complicated ways to do this, but i need the simplest method. im not a php guru by any stretch, so this doesnt have to be the end all method thats mega complex for only a 1% security increase

any ideas?

1904,720,"So it's way too early in the year for anything concrete, but I've got a nice little monetary injection coming in February and want to have some idea of what I'm going to do with it. 

Currently my plan is to spend Spring in Romania and Ukraine, then fly to Toronto in June as it's getting hot. If I get an email this month I'll stop by Hamilton and pick someone up, but otherwise from Toronto I plan to hitchhike north to a lake in Alberta called [Lake Louise.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lake_Louise_17092005.jpg) 

Ideally, I want to spend a few weeks camping in the surrounding area. It's been forever since I've done that, and the lake looks so gorgeous that it seems it would be the perfect place to do so. 

Alternatively I'd be going as far north as possible and trying to catch the aurora borealis. 

So, Lake Louise and Alberta as a whole- lovely dovely or is there a prettier place to camp in Canada? "
6901,619,"Hi all,

 I was running Xmbc Live 9, worked great.

Saw 10 was out, fancied a go on that.

* Downloaded the ISO and burnt to DVD.

* Put in media centre computer, booted DVD, chose to install Xbmc Live

* Went through the local settings all fine

* Chose network adapter

Then it asked about hard disks - I told it to use the existing hard disk, but all of it - so it did it's formating/partition magic etc, and then began to install

however, at 16%, a funny menu popped up:

[Funny menu](http://i.imgur.com/wJjJK.jpg)

I've tried everything - any option I choose, it goes back to the install screen, starts again from 0%, gets to 16% then pops back up.

I've downloaded and burnt the ISO twice now, still the same problem.

Any help would be fantastic, thanks"

My dream would be to retire early because I am lazy and would rather enjoy life and write my books and skydive and smell flowers than sit behind a desk.

A ""crate raffle"".

Here's how it would work:

9 people buy in with a scrap metal. The metals are crafted to make one refined. The refined is traded for a key. A crate (either found or donated) is opened with the key. Now the fun part!

Each person can select two categories of the following: *Weapon, Tool (paint/tags), Hat, or Unusual*. If the item unboxed from the crate is in the category this person chose, they will be put in a raffle with the others who chose that category and the winner of the drawing will receive the item.

*Proposed Rules. Give me feedback on these for fairness:*

The Weapon category may be removed and raffled at random to one of the 9 people rather than have a slot for it.

If no players chose a category, and the item is in the unchosen category, the item will be kept by the raffler. This is important, I need to know if you think this is fair.

Donations of a crate are allowed as a slot, but the raffle will be expanded to 10 slots if one is not found at random.

I'm encountering a problem that i can only seem to find brief references to online and through google. I recently threw an 80GB Vertex2 (non-extended) SSD into my UL80 (and my brother's UL30) notebook and have since seen that the laptop crashes everytime it resumes from standby.

Some research into the subject has shown that it has something to do with the standby state that the laptop is going into (S1 or S2 versus S3 that is required?) but I can't seem to change it in the notebook's bios, nor can i find a setting from within Windows (7, fresh installation).

I read that updating the drive's firmware may help, but when i got OCZ's update tool, it wouldn't detect the drive...

When I bought my Blackberry, I thought about the 30-year business I ran with 1800 employees, all without a cell phone that plays music, takes videos, pictures and communicates with Facebook and Twitter. I signed up under duress for Twitter and Facebook, so my seven kids, their spouses, 13 grandkids and 2 great grand kids could communicate with me in the modern way. I figured I could handle something as simple as Twitter with only 140 characters of space.

That was before one of my grandkids hooked me up for Tweeter, Tweetree, Twhirl, Twitterfon, Tweetie and Twittererific Tweetdeck, Twitpix and something that sends every message to my cell phone and every other program within the texting world.

My phone was beeping every three minutes with the details of everything except the bowel movements of the entire next generation. I am not ready to live like this. I keep my cell phone in the garage in my golf bag.

The kids bought me a GPS for my last birthday because they say I get lost every now and then going over to the grocery store or library. I keep that in a box under my tool bench with the Blue tooth [its red] phone I am supposed to use when I drive. I wore it once and was standing in line at Barnes and Noble talking to my wife and everyone in the nearest 50 yards was glaring at me. I had to take my hearing aid out to use it, and I got a little loud.

I mean the GPS looked pretty smart on my dash board, but the lady inside that gadget was the most annoying, rudest person I had run into in a long time. Every 10 minutes, she would sarcastically say, ""Re-calc-u-lating.""  You would think that she could be nicer. It was like she could barely tolerate me. She would let go with a deep sigh and then tell me to make a U-turn at the next light. Then if I made a right turn instead. Well, it was not a good relationship.
When I get really lost now, I call my wife and tell her the name of the cross streets and while she is starting to develop the same tone as Gypsy, the GPS lady, at least she loves me.

To be perfectly frank, I am still trying to learn how to use the cordless phones in our house. We have had them for 4 years, but I still haven't figured out how I can lose three phones all at once and have run around digging under chair cushions and checking bathrooms and the dirty laundry baskets when the phone rings.

The world is just getting too complex for me. They even mess me up every time I go to the grocery store. You would think they could settle on something themselves but this sudden ""Paper or Plastic?"" every time I check out just knocks me for a loop. I bought some of those cloth reusable bags to avoid looking confused, but I never remember to take them in with me.

Now I toss it back to them. When they ask me, ""Paper or Plastic?"" I just say, ""Doesn't matter to me. I am bi-sacksual.""  Then it's their turn to stare at me with a blank look. I was recently asked if I tweet. I answered, No, but I do toot a lot.""

8191,290,"I checked and didnt see any kind of FAQ for this community (this saddens me as Im sure what I am about to ask is a common questions).

Im a big guy 6'3"" 370lbs and am trying to get into shap. I lift weights, do cardio, etc a few days a week, and am looking to do something on my off days to gain some flexibility. Yoga seems like a good thing for that.

It looks like there are tons of styles of yoga, but I really have no idea which would be best for me. Im not a spiritual or meditation type of person, so I dont have any preferance as far as that goes, but do want something that will be complimentary for the weight lifting, weight loss portion of my current fitness goals.

Any suggestions? Or DVDs/websites that may have some info on this?"

4310,239,"Las Vegas, NV, January 13, 2011 -- One of the perennially popular New Year’s Resolutions is to slim down, and the IAPAM offers dieters 10 Tips for healthy eating in the New Year. Also, to help physicians add medical supervised weight management to a practice, the IAPAM's hCG Training offers the industry's most comprehensive education for adding hCG for weight loss to a medical practice.
 
To help physicians meet the needs of motivated patients, the IAPAM offers the industry's leading hCG for Weight Loss Training program (http://www.aestheticmedicinesymposium.com/physician-hcg-weight-loss-training).  Attendees at the IAPAM's hCG Training learn from expert physicians, pharmacists and other specialists in the field of hCG and medical weight management, and are given all the tools, resources and instruction needed to profitably add hCG for Weight Loss to their practices right away. 
 
The IAPAM is dedicated to offering physicians and their patients enduring weight management strategies, so once a patient has reached their goal weight, use these tips to help them maintain their new weight:
 
-  Don't eat family style, you're much more likely to eat more than you would if you placed the correct portion size on a plate. 
-  Healthy restaurant menus may not be so healthy. You're likely to underestimate a meal’s calorie total by more than a third, according to a study in the Journal of Consumer Research. 
-  Alcohol makes you hungry (limit it to one or two glasses per meal) 
-  Restaurant portions are way too big, your choices are: (1) eat an appetizer, or (2) split an entre (either with another diner, or bring the other half home for another meal). 
-  Beware of office goodies. The office can be a source of 10-20lbs of fat per year. Skip the cakes, donuts, candies, and chocolates. 
-  Portion out your snacks. If you are going to have chips, read the bag and fill a bowl with a serving, then put the big bag away so you can't see it. 
-  Hungry an hour after a meal? Have a glass of water, or go for a brisk walk. 
-  Display fruits, not sweets. Get rid of the glass covered sweets display, and replace it with a fruit bowl. 
-  Researchers discovered that people who watched TV while they ate consumed nearly 300 more calories than those who dined without an eye on the tube. 
-  Slow down while you eat. If you consciously stop to take a breath between bites, you can cut your food (and calorie) intake by 10 percent, according to researchers at the University of Rhode Island. It takes 20 minutes for the news that you've had enough to eat to travel from your gut to your brain. Another tip, try talking more between bites. 
   
The IAPAM's hCG Physician Weight Loss Training offers physicians a full-day of intensive education on the clinical best practices of hCG for weight loss, lipotropic injections and Very Low Calorie Diet (VLCD) programs. Physicians and their staff will learn the exclusive IAPAM hCG for Weight Loss Protocol (based on Dr. Simeons manuscript, Pounds and Inches.) The IAPAM's program gives physicians ""everything they need to start offering medical weight loss programs to their patients immediately upon returning to their practices,"" emphasizes Jeff Russell, Executive Director of the IAPAM, and one of the IAPAM faculty instructors presenting at the IAPAM's hCG training. Also, the IAPAM's full day hCG training is the only hCG medical weight loss training in North America approved for a special medical malpractice coverage for those who have attended and have been certified by the IAPAM.  
 
In 2010, all of the IAPAM's hCG Medical Weight Management seminars sold out, so to register for the next session in 2011, please see  http://www.aestheticmedicinesymposium.com/physician-hcg-weight-loss-training, or contact the IAPAM at info (at) theiapam.com or 1-800-219-5108 ext 708.

2295,257,"Story- I was a HUGE dick in highschool. I didnt care about ANYONE other than myself. 

I was a TERRIBLE boyfriend(would cheat on girls, ignore them unless i wanted something, etc)

I was a horrible person in general.
I looked for fights, i was mean to people for no reason, i thought i was entitled because i was spoiled growing up.


Looking back i HATE who i WAS.


I have been doing a lot of soul searching, deciding who i want to be.
Ive done a lot of looking back at past decisions ive made...all i feel is regret.


I didnt have a specific point that i wanted to start doing good instead of being a complete dick and all around bad person.

Ive just been coming on here a lot and noticing how people here are SO selfless.

It got me thinking how i was such a selfish person and how i deserve to be in the place i have been(poor, lonely, empty).



I know those i have hurt in my short life might never believe i am different but i KNOW it is not just an act.


3 people i can pick out in my mind vividly from highschool are who i wanted to start out trying to make amends with.



1. my ex girlfriend- i sent naked pictures of her that she gave me to a couple guys...they sent it to a few friends...in the end it got around her entire school


2. The boyfriend of my ex girlfriend(she dated him after me)- i got in a stupid argument with him over her and we ended up getting into a fight...long story short i won.(i won a physical confrontation...looking back he won in being the bigger man and ignoring me after)


3. A guy a grade younger than me- he tried to sell me and a couple ""friends""(no longer associate myself with them) weed. Long story short i robbed him and scared the living shit out of him. &lt;--- THIS is my biggest regret in my entire life.





What i have done so far- I have apologized to my ex girlfriend. As many of the ladies here would guess from if the situation happened to them...she does not and will never forgive me. I can live with that. I am happy with my girlfriend now but I am happy knowing i sincerely apologized and she knows that i have.

Her ex boyfriend- I saw him at a party recently and confronted him. At first he thought i wanted to fight him again but i told him i am different and that i felt terrible about what happened. I told him he was a good person and i was a terrible person and that i am trying to fix myself and was hoping he would forgive me for being such an asshole.

HE FORGAVE ME AND SHOOK MY HAND!&lt;-- this blew me away.



And finally- The kid i robbed.


i sent him a message explaining what happened before the ""incident"" just so he could have some closure on what all happened. 

I then told him that i didnt expect him to ever forgive me. I told him i was deeply sorry and that i just wanted to let him know i regretted doing what i did.


I have yet to receive a message from him but look foreward to it.



I Dont know.
I guess i made this to thank every single person here that helps other people.


When you give back to other people your kindness stretches not only to those who you help...but also to assholes like me.


I am a changed person and for the first time in a long time...i am happy with myself.



Thank you reddit

##Stats:


&gt;Sex? 

&gt;&gt;Female.


&gt;Age? 

&gt;&gt;Born in 1986.


&gt;Relationship Status? 


&gt;&gt;Single, ohhhyeah.


##Favorites:


&gt;Cats or Dogs? 


&gt;&gt;Both, actually. At the age of one, my parents purchased a puppy and her and I were great friends until she died when I was 17. I found it difficult to ever get another dog - so when I had the opportunity to choose my own pets: I got two cats. One is a killer - the other is a cuddle-whore.


&gt;Favorite beverage? 


&gt;&gt;Haha, honestly, chocolate Soy Milk. But blue kool-aid will always hold a special place in my heart.



&gt;Food? 


&gt;&gt;Okay, this is going to sound really weird but ... I love toast.


&gt;Movie/tv show? 


&gt;&gt;Movies, movies...Short Circuit Series, Totoro, and many many others I can't seem to remember right now. TV : Battlestar Galactica ( Re-Imagined ) was by far the one of the best reasons to turn on the TV. Ever.



&gt;Music? 


&gt;&gt;Such a hard question. I dance to trance &amp; dubstep, chill to rock, thrash to metal, and reflect to piano and acoustic stuff. I'm one of those people that listens to things based on what mood I'm in ( or want to be in ). Notable favs : Dax Riggs, 36Crazyfists, OceanLab, Armin, and the works of Maynard James K.



&gt;Book? 


&gt;&gt;Never really had a book that I'd call my favorite. But I am a big Lovecraft fan.



&gt;Game? 


&gt;&gt;I have... many favs. Starcraft, of course. The Thief series. Does anyone really need to name Portal? I think we all agree that's just a given. Unreal. A racing game here or there. AND HOLY HELL Mischief Makers - for some reason this game makes me giggle and lose track of time no matter how many times I beat it. Lastly, let's not forget Earthbound.
HEY WHY WASN'T COMIC ON THIS LIST. I have a giant geek-girl crush on Randall Munroe. =)



##Miscellanea:



&gt;What makes you laugh? 


&gt;&gt;Well-placed sarcasm. Reddit. Monty Python. Eddie Izzard if he's wearing too much make-up ; C.K. Lewis if I'm feeling depressed.



&gt;What is your biggest pet peeve? 


&gt;&gt;The first thing that came to mind was ""not using your turn-signal"". Makes me think of that scene in Shoot 'Em up. Yep. Let's go with that.



&gt;What general area of your country you live in? 


&gt;&gt;The general western area of Canada.



&gt;Do you love it? 


&gt;&gt;I love the idea of leaving it! Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed snow when I was little. Sleds and skiing and running around and making forts AND snow-fights = awesome. Having to plug in your car, scrape your car, waking up earlier, waiting in traffic longer, oh - and that feeling when you're worried your eyeballs are going to freeze = not awesome. I'd be up for somewhere warmer.


&gt;What was the best thing about the last year? 

&gt;&gt;The best thing about last year was all the wonderful new people I met through my job. One of whom is now officially my ""sister from far away"" - we met up and invested in some matching ink - very fun. I really think it's quite phenomenal how people come together - and how amazing it is to find people that really connect with you.



&gt;What are you looking forward to in the year ahead? 


&gt;&gt;The unexpected things; they're my favorite.



&gt;If You Were Granted One Do-over, What Would It Be? 


&gt;&gt;I'd pick one of those times I procrastinated too much and ended up staying up all night to finish a ton of work - am a zombie the next day - and sleep for way too long the next night. How about I save the do-over for one of those moments - and get a few extra days? ;)



&gt;A butterfly flaps its wings... what small thing have you done or said that lead to something disproportionately larger? 


&gt;&gt;Heck. I drew a silly comic.



&gt;All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you? 


&gt;&gt;Just as I was about to give this long-winded answer about truth and the pursuit of meaning ; I burst out laughing and decided to settle for : ""new ways to challenge myself"". I think living ( *growing, learning ) is the most important thing in the world.



##Concerning reddit:



&gt;What is the origin or meaning of your user name? 


&gt;&gt;For whatever reason, I had ""prime"" in my head. Lots of great things are associated with prime : Optimus prime, prime numbers, the prime directive, the movie primer. So as I sat staring at my monitor, trying to think of a cool way to incorporate prime, YUREKA, 'dem pixels!! Pixelprime was born.



&gt;Total number of reddit identities you’ve had? 


&gt;&gt;Only this one, actually. Lurked for soooooooo long without one. But now that so many people know my name ( and that I'm female ) - I'll definitely explore some secret identities



&gt;What is your favorite part of reddit? 


&gt;&gt;The part where someone says something unexpected and I laugh for five minutes. Suffice to say ; the people are my favorite part.



&gt;What do you do when you’re not on reddit? 


&gt;&gt;Work, work, work. Sometimes I sleep. Sometimes.



&gt;Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so? 


&gt;&gt;YES. Have you read those stats? Awesome.



&gt;If so, do you think it’s been for the better? 


&gt;&gt;I try to think positive. Nothing's perfect, right?



##Final Question: 


&gt;Is there anything you'd like to plug/promote/advocate? 


&gt;&gt;I feel like dumping some links would be bad form. But I will say this : for the last many years I've run my own business doing photography &amp; graphic design - I specifically cater to the music &amp; fashion industry - if anyone was curious or in need of such things, I always love meeting new people. =)

The crew opened fire with 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns, but my uncle wasn't part of the gunning crew. At last, a mere single plane remained. My uncle drew his Colt .45 and aimed at the plane as it came in for a strafing run. He didn't fire, but yelled ""Bang!"" At that specific moment, a 40mm shell struck the plane perfectly and sent it careening into the water. My uncle promptly blew across the barrel as of clearing gunsmoke and holstered the pistol.

I mean, when the whole Nefarious shit eventually poured over from /r/MW2, I was a tad concerned. But now it seems like it's one huge circlejerk over there.

Most of you are aware that the gamertag appending system that's being used in codbo was contributed and is solely maintained by myself. I don't mind doing it myself, but I'm seriously tired of all the messages I get from people who don't read the multiple warnings screeching because they feel entitled to see their gamertag after their name the second they submit it, and telling me I'm not being fair, blah blah blah blah.

I'm tired of being bitched out publicly because I don't do my ""job"" fast enough. I'd dig up the thread but it was awhile back and it's late. Basically, what happened was someone started a thread on codbo complaining their tag wasn't showing up. I had just worked some long shifts a few days prior and didn't get around to/forgot to update the stylesheet with the new tags. I posted a comment (as a moderator) explaining that I had fallen a bit behind, and I apologized to everyone and updated it right away. I was immediately downvoted and bitched at by multiple members of the community, who went on to imply that the whole moderating staff was lazy and wasn't doing their ""jobs"".

Honestly, I love moderating the subreddit. I do my best to keep the tags up to date and the subreddit free of spam and extreme comments/posts. I do what I can, when I can.

But it doesn't seem worth it anymore. I don't get that same satisfaction that I got before when I worked on the tagger and updated the stylesheet. Because now, no matter how hard I try, it never seems to be good enough to anyone.

Tonight, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/ewdcu/yes_i_will_abuse_this_map_until_treyarch_fixes_it). The fact that this has so many upvotes is a good definition of the type of community that /r/codbo is becoming. Encouraging someone to not play the objective and farm kills off of poor guys and girls who just got the game is not good manner, and yet the upvotes seem to encourage it. While there are downvotes, from the sensible ones, it boggles my mind that the post remains in the positive numbers.

I know this is probably the wrong place to bitch, but I just wanted to throw that out there without once again being downvoted into oblivion and flamed for it.

(With that being said, you guys are all awesome. I always enjoy playing with each and everyone with you, and I will continue to do so for as long as I can. This community is a defining example of what /r/codbo should be, and it's unfortunate that it's not.)

Retail Internet rates, quality of service and business practices

A retail customer is the end user who purchases access to the Internet. The CRTC does not regulate rates, quality of service issues or business practices of Internet service providers as they relate to retail customers. This is because there is enough competition in the market that retail customers can shop around for service packages.

Wholesale Internet rates and quality of service

A wholesale customer is an Internet service provider who buys bandwidth in order to access the Internet from a cable or telephone company and then resells that access to retail customers. The CRTC regulates rates and quality of service issues for wholesale services. The CRTC regulates the relationship between these resellers and the cable and telephone companies who own the infrastructure needed to provide Internet access, in order to ensure that Canadians have access to a range of Internet providers.

Claim: We don't regulate your internet rates.
Truth: We regulate everyone's rates.

And now they state that 15% lower than the Big Three's end user rates for independents is all that is required to promote competition. So let me get this straight, if Bell wants to charge 15% more to you, all isp's that rent from them have to charge you 15% more. Way to keep it competitive. Oh, and thanks for not regulating my rates."
3754,97,"Заканчиваются рождественско-новогодние каникулы и впереди рабочие будни, но эта перспектива радует не многих. Психологи диагностируют это состояние как «постотпускной синдром», которое выражается в депрессии, хандре, нежелании выходить на работу. 

Известный своими афоризмами английский литератор Элберт Г. Хаббард (1856-1915г. г) в своё время написал: «Никто так не нуждается в отпуске, как человек, только что вернувшийся из отпуска». У кого есть такая возможность, действительно снова уходят в отпуск, как в запой – продлевая и продлевая удовольствие. Это подтверждается и российскими туроператорами. Они признают, что к ним нередко обращаются отпускники, которые всего лишь неделю назад вернулись из путешествия. 

 Врачи сетуют на физиологическую перестройку всего организма во время отпуска, а знатоки душ человеческих отдают всё во власть разума. И  в этом они отчасти правы. 

Спустя десятки лет, в 1981 году, племянник Элберта - Рон Хаббард, известный гуманист, философ, писатель, снова поднял проблему отношения человека к работе. В своём нерелигиозном кодексе «Дорога к счастью» Рон Хаббард определил одно из 21 описанных в книге моральных наставлений как - «Будьте трудолюбивы». В одноимённой главе, автор описывает несчастного человека, состояние которого вызвано банальным бездельем. Автор пишет: «Работать не всегда приятно. ... Даже горе можно облегчить, просто занявшись чем-то. Когда человек добивается чего-то, это очень, очень высоко поднимает его моральных дух. Фактически можно продемонстрировать, что производство является основой морального духа»

На пороге 2011 год, но проблема отношения человека к работе остаётся, и одним из решений этого является простое воспитание чувства любви к труду.

3587,621,"Hi all,

This is my first posting.  I have struggled with weight gain throughout my whole life.  Even as an athlete I was overweight.  I played basketball and soccer through 8th grade and soccer throughout high school (both club and for school).  14 years of soccer and I was still getting fat and gaining weight.  I did see some weight loss my sophomore year when I went through a huge growth spurt and was at my peak shape, but I got a pnemonia and all of my conditioning was whiped out.  I always had trouble with cardio and running due to asthma, and I just could not for the life of me get back into running shape.  After my senior year and my competitive career ended, I became lazy and stopped working out and running.  I was discouraged by the inability to run and how hard it was to get back to where I had been.  

Long story short, I got to college and everyone puts on the freshman 15, but mine was sort of 50.  I saw some good results weightlifting with my old roomate, but I had to stop due to an elbow injury last year and I have become sooooooo lazy that I have gotten to the highest weight I've ever been.  I no longer have the ability to go to the gym, but I am really excited about starting the power 90 workout series.   I hope to make it last a lifetime and lose close to 100 lbs over the next few years.  I need your support redditors!! I have already gotten my girlfriend and best friend to continually push me, but the more people I have to make myself accountable for, the more likely I will succeed (which was the area I lacked before).

You know what it's like watching wildlife such as cardinals that are 1/100th of our size flutter around while it's completely silent outside with a snow flooded back drop? It's serene. 
 
You know what it's like waking up sweating with bees flying all over the place and not being able to cool off...AT ALL for more than the amount of time it takes to swim in an infested pool or scummy lake? That's called summer."
6339,638,"Some people have suggested that we let Ents vote up / down on their favorite photos that people will hopefully submit for the Trees Gone Wild calendar. This is a great idea!

What I'm thinking is that we make the calendars useful by taking the next six months to receive submitted photos and design it. Then the calendar can display from the end of 2011 through early 2013.. giving people more months for their donation money. :p

The reason I use calendars instead of calendar is because it has occurred to me that it would be great in addition to the TGW calendar to also produce a calendar based on art submissions.

One calendar will be slightly NSFW.. the TGW calendar will be bikinis and whatnot. Some people will be interested to buy it. A second calendar will be for art that Ents have made and submit to the calendar project. This calendar will be SFW."

6159,609,"It's a small house.  Here is a picture of the [living room / kitchen](http://i.imgur.com/GPcAz.jpg). As you can see, it's a fairly consistent look.  The hardwood flooring matches the cabinets as well as the trim around the doors.  I would like to keep this the same.  The tiles in the kitchen are light gray.

I was wondering what paint color would work nicely here.  There's a large window in the living room which gets a lot of light, so I was thinking a dark color would work good, but then would that make the room appear too small?  If someone could point me to a similar looking house with dark flooring/cabinets that has a good color would be appreciated too.

I was also wondering if I should replace the white baseboards to match the flooring/door trim?  I'll also go with any other suggestions you guys may have to make this place look nice.

Mattsonmaps President and former professor at Temple University in Philadelphia just published a white paper in the prestigious travel tech news site called tnooz.com. The White Paper, as summation of a market research study done in conjunction with the Rohrer Business School at Rowan University, surveyed 650 destination marketing organization to determine tool use and plans for tool acquisition. For the purpose of this study, Mattsonmaps defined tools as interactive and downloadable maps, events calendars, itineraries-builders, newsletters, coupons, slideshows, advertisements, and data mining utilities.

The survey was used to demonstrate a five-class taxonomy based on tool use, DMO size, and organizational staffing. It also recorded respondent commentary providing useful insights into otherwise statistical findings.

An early review of the article said, “[The article] is an early must-read for the year…”

Mattsonmaps found that DMOs fell into one or several of the following categories: (1) Capacity Under-Performers; (2) Technology Prisoners; (3) Widows and Orphans; (4) Big Men on Campus; and (5) Market Under-Performers.

1627,315,"I'm really stressing out because a client just told my contractor that I offered her morphine, when I clearly did not. I might lose the contract over this because I became really flustered and emotional when arguing against wether I did it with the contractor. 

Even locally, I had someone whom I was trying to become friends with tell me off because I ""look like a stoner"".

I don't do drugs, nor smoke, nor drink, never have. What am I doing wrong that makes me appear this way to so many people? (pic of myself http://i.imgur.com/zeT7V.png )

I don't even know what to say to my contractor to keep my position. He implied that I was a huge liar because my stories appeared all over the place about what happened, which I hardly remember plus he won't try to understand me. Her daughter had to be rushed to the ER to which I PROLLY asked is I could help since I PROLLY had an emergency kit in the car (a MRE ration, which I refer to as an emergency kit) to which she would say her daughter had a cyst and was in pain, to which I would've PROLLY said (like a moron) she prolly needs some morphine or something (since I don't know anything about medicine). Just trying to help someone in pain...

Now the client claims I had morphine in my car and offered it. Advice?

Update: It's a W2 contract. Even though I did the work as promised but dismissed by the client due to the client's emergency, the nullified my pay, $70, and left the negative reveiw on my record. The person on the phone also hinted that I might already be fired for offering medical advice in the client's emergency situation.

Obviously a site that censored unpopular comments from a centralized perspective would receive much flak, but on reddit, I can't seem to talk about my finding transsexualism weird, or why I don't like PC gaming, or why I think sometimes atheists have the wrong idea, and people find that totally okay that I get downvoted to oblivion and hidden for saying those things. It's almost as if reddit is saying as a community, ""we have arguments for all of our opinions, so yours are invalid"". It's one thing to go around wishing the reddiquette were better-followed, which most of us do, but at this point it's gotten to where I actually take some discussions to 4chan just so I can post something and have it read and responded to. Am I really the only one who wishes people were ""allowed"" to have different opinions here?

10735,604,"Hi, I'm am atheist. And this is not an attempted 'gotcha'. 

I know quite a lot of liberal christians, and most of them have had several points in common: they've held that the bible is not particularly inerrant, that it is not to be taken literally, and that what might appear to be the straightforward metaphorical/allegorical interpretation of any given passage can be misleading, that you need cultural and textual context to get a sane take on it - and that on top of that, the authors had their own flaws and spin. 

Fair enough, I'm down with that. 

And I find some aspects of Christianity interesting, both from a social-engineering perspective, and as a set of best practices for both interpersonal and PvE situations. 

Which, indeed, a bunch of my libchris friends stress is the important point anyway - whether or not a god exists, they maintain that this is a good way to live anyway. 

Well, I'm inclined to agree on some of the details and disagree on others - but in order to judge it fairly, I'd need a stationary set of goalposts defined for it.

Thing is, I'm an engineering major. I don't really do abstruse semiotic analysis of ancient cultures, and there is precisely *zero* poetry in my soul. Trying to reach me indirectly through poetic, emotional language is about as fruitful as explaining differential calculus to a dog. 

I can handle abstract philosophical concepts just fine, however, when people say what they actually mean, instead of getting all coy with parables and whatnot. 

So, what I think would be really interesting would be an absolutely literal, face-value, explicit summary of the most important principles and facts about the whole system, in outline form - with principles stated abstractly, then followed up with *annotated* examples and analogies as necessary. 

Actual *documentation*, in other words. 

Contentious issues like what precisely 'salvation' is, whether it's by ones deeds, or by 'grace' or 'faith' (and precisely what's meant by *those* terms) would be very interesting to see derived from first principles, once said principles were established. I mean yes, anything can be prooftexted, but again, cultural context and whatnot devalues prooftexting to virtually nothing. Matters of opinion are fine, so long as they're labelled as such, and workings are shown :)

I'd love to see what the whole system boils down to once you paraphrase it concisely. 

(I know, I know, 'love'. Or as I put it: be egregiously nice to everybody, especially the ones you don't want to be nice to. But few, I think, would call *me* a christian...)

So, anyone want to start work on this?"

Hi guys. So seddit has topped 15,000 users! Quite the achievement, wouldn't you say?

To celebrate this milestone, we will be introducing two brand new features which we hope will bring our community to the next level. We feel seddit is the most vibrant and promising seduction forum on the internet, and we're going to try and keep it that way!

**FEATURE #1: Locally based sedditor lairs**

With over 15,000 users, many located in the same cities, we feel it's time to facilitate more real world meet-ups. We will be launching with Los Angeles and Tokyo as the pilot lairs, with the hope that others will grow organically. If you would like to establish a lair for your area, please see if there are any interested people in your local community and contact the seddit moderators for further details.

The idea was presented to us by sedditor withClass to establish a Los Angeles based sub-seddit. You can find it at [/r/LosAngelesSeddit/](http://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngelesSeddit/). 

The Tokyo lair will be located at [/r/TokyoSeddit/](http://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoSeddit/). 

For now, all lairs will be featured prominently on the sidebar, too.

These semi-private communities will allow for easy management of logistics for meetups and discussions. All field reports and strategy developing in these lairs will be posted into the main seddit, cross-posted for archival in the sub-seddits. Time to find some wingmen, gentlemen!

All those interested in joining the Tokyo lair, please message me, [TofuTofu](http://www.reddit.com/user/TofuTofu/). All those interested in the Los Angeles lair, please contact [withClass](http://www.reddit.com/user/withClass/).

**FEATURE #2: ""IAMA mPUA"" Interview Series**

Yes, we're finally at critical mass to have some of the better known mPUAs (master PUAs) visit our seduction forum. Thanks to SpiderFan for the idea and for EvolutionTheory for organizing the first interviewees.

There's a whole body of knowledge and experience these masters of seduction can share with us, so it's time to get those questions brewing. We get to pick their minds and they get to showcase to us what they have been up to in the seduction community at large. (Don't worry, seddit isn't selling out. This is strictly them volunteering their time, so please be cordial and give them a shot!)

Our first guest has been confirmed as [Savoy](http://www.lovesystems.com/team-bios/savoy) from [Love Systems](http://www.lovesystems.com/). We will allow approximately one week for questions to be up/downvoted and the top ten questions will be sent to each mPUA. In addition they will return for a live IAMA session approximately one week after the initial thread goes up.

I hope you guys are excited for this as we are! More details to follow soon once we confirm the dates with the mPUAs.

If any of you have connections to mPUAs who might be interested in doing an IAMA, please reach out to the moderators here for details. We are actively seeking more interviewees.

We hope to have this as a regular feature on seddit, but the first one with Savoy will be the pilot, so we ask for as much involvement as you can give us!

Lastly, the sidebar WILL finally get that overhaul soon. If you have any unique ideas for how to do it, please contact the moderators.

(NOTE: The message the moderator link is to your right. Or the lazy can use [this link](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23seduction).)

Thanks and happy sedditing, gentlemen!"
6871,108,"I guess I always took it for granted that it was kind of a novelty thing that most people knew about these days, like tea-bagging, but I recently had to define this to 4 different people, all adults.  First to two people that didn't understand a joke I had made and then afterwards to two more people as I was relating to them my incredulity that the first two didn't know what bukkake meant.

The worst part is that now these 4 people think I'm into doing gangbang facials or something like that.

Edit: Sorry.  I again wrongly assumed that a community of internet dwellers would know what this was.  By request, I think bukkake can be loosely defined as the covering of a woman or women in copious amounts of semen, usually on the face, and usually by as many anonymous dicks as possible.  *sigh* That's 3 times in 2 days now."

Yes I realize the inherent problems with karma whoring (whoever posts europe first gets mad karma etc) but I think that sometimes people worry too much about karma and think that is what reddit is all about when really it is about spreading information, socializing and entertaining.

Now, she's afraid of going back to this place, which is one of the few things she loves to do and still can do.

I'm afraid she might be superstitioning herself into a corner. I did all the normal things like asking her to think of *good* things this person has done, and she came up with some behaviors that sounded like they belong to a very good person, as I've mostly known Pagans to be (generally - some are frothing stupid, too). 

But she changed the subject, and I can't seem to convince her that these ""Pagan hexes"" work just about as well as her prayers.

How do you argue against it? She's not susceptible to being an atheist about all the other religions, because she's not. She also thinks the Bible is the divinely-inspired text of God.

I think at this point, I might just never respond to her concerns about things like this again, but she will still be painting herself into a fearful corner. Her mother died like this, and I'd hate to see her do so as well."

The league is a Co-Ed league on Wednesday evenings with games starting at 630, 730, 830, and 930.  Slide tackles are not allowed and the games are pretty friendly.  They have more competitive leagues on other nights, but the Wednesday is Co-Ed less competitive players.

We need at least 8 players for a team and we can have up to 14 players.  The cost per team is $680 regardless of the number of players.  I'm hoping we will be able to fill up and entire team roster of 14 so the cost would be $49 per player.  The league lasts about 10 to 12 weeks.

Considering the vast amount of tools at our disposal, it's inexcusable to let music, as an art form, fall off. **so let's put our knowledge and skills use.** I believe it's **our** time to change things... and accessible websites like Reddit.com make such things a real possibility. **now is our time.**


Anyway, MC Sadach, DJ Dennah, Raerth, Andrew.. Dizzy, Ross.. **all of you** thanks so much for helping out. Thanks to whoever you are for reading this.

- Allows for features web based Reddit doesn't, like adding text to the body, when posting links (like is done on one of the Reddit apps for iOS... I believe Alien Blue allows it)  

- Allow for a nicer look to everything, have a snazzy interface 

- Opens links in Safari/Chrome/whatever the hell you use. 

- For people that share a comp, this allows for an app that you can log into easier (i.e. not logging in and out on browser based Reddit)

- Might get you to stuff faster when Reddit is all slow and crashy (for some reason the Alien Blue app on my iPod touch connects better than my computer when Reddit is slow)

- Integrated posting onto Imgur

- Buttons for all your subscribed subreddits

2039,244,"* Swimming is great for weight loss

* Swimming is terrible for weight loss

* Swimming has no detrimental impacts(apart from drowning :-))

My background: I mod [r/swimming](http://www.reddit.com/r/swimming). Feel free to join us. I'm 40s &amp; I HAVE NOT been swimming all my life so I don't have the usually subconscious prejudices some competitive-since-kids pool swimmers have. 

I've read some studies on weight loss in swimming that are often repeated that show swimming in adult females 3 times a week for 30 minutes was [not effective](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3618879?dopt=Abstract) for weight loss and may cause weight gain.

I've also seen personally many swimmers who gain no benefit from swimming regularly (maybe 3 or even 4 times a week). 

Some points:

* It is NOT true that swimming has no negative effects. Incorrect technique combined with poor swim training regularly causes shoulder impingement (rotator cuff) problems in adult-onset swimmers (front crawl) because of lack of muscle-stabilisation in the counterbalancing muscles. RT injury (which is really a tendinitis problem rather than the shoulder joint) can become quite painful and difficult to address without the correct remediation knowledge (but is actually easy to fix if you know how). Competitive swimmers rarely know about this problem because their training programs are designed to aid muscle stabilisation and avoid the problem.

{The problem is easily avoided by adding 10 to 15% backstroke to a front crawl training problem and limiting the use of paddles.}

The reasons why so many people fail to find swimming effective for weight loss are threefold:

1. They neglect eating before swimming.

2. They fail to recognise the effect of swimming to stimulate appetite and eat more than they realise afterwards.

3. People don't understand how to swim train effectively.  

Explanation:

1. People want to lose weight so they don't eat before swimming. Therefore they often have insufficient energy. Correct swimming is a high energy activity and requires muscle gyclogen. You won't swim well on a low-carb diet. Eat before you swim. Fruit or porridge or such.

2. Swimming stimulates appetite for 2 reasons. One is the energy expenditure. The other is the water temperature, even in a warm pool, is less than body temp. Swimming in cold water like I do exaggerates this effect to a phenomenal degree. Cold takes energy while doing it and MORE in rewarming the body afterwards.

3. Swimmers train a LOT. For competitive pool swimmers it's 10 to 12 times a week, 2 hours or more a time.
 
The much reported 12kcals per day for Phelps is the result of intensive training of 4 to 6 hours a day, 6 days a week combined with size and water temperature.

The structure of swim training is based around intervals and a high training load. It is high intensity training. Even very long distance swimmers like me do not just swim up and down. We use short rest intervals, daily variations of training programs and train at aerobic thresholds. 

Calorie consumption of running is about 900 kcals per hour. For a swimmer *properly training* calorie consumption is about 850 kcals p.h.

In short, I hope this helps with future discussion of weight loss for swimming. It can be effective IF you follow the guidelines.

EDIT: I forgot to add this. One of the biggest problems with swimming for beginners is that they are unable to breathe properly. The consequence of this is that believe they are exercising far harder than that what they actually are. You may be breathing hard but actually only using the same energy as a leisurely walk. I have seen this happen many many times. 

The best solution for people taking up swimming is to get some stroke advice as close to starting as possible. If you improve your stroke even marginally, you will improve your efficiency and you will swim harder."

7479,291,"Robert WXXXX's facebook ""About Me"" 


I am one who loves to think. I often transform simplicity into complexity through endless thought. Sometimes it is a fault that leads to much overlooked, but it often leads to a greater understanding of the more minute details. I think logic and rhetoric are important to any thought. Like most people, I find it so tough to capacitate the indefinite. Have you ever tried imaging the universe and thinking about where it ends? The chances are that you found yourself lost in thought. We, as humans, simply have the most difficult time understanding what is infinite and we try to see thought in containment as if it has bounds. Thought has no bounds and will forever expand. Where will it expand? This is the point. You can't capacitate that can you? For the indefinite, my only logical explanation is God. I have a strong faith that helps satisfy my seemingly unquenchable thirst for understanding. I simply believe and put it all to him as he is the one who constructed this masterpiece. I am majoring in Political Science at UF (c/o 2013) and will likely graduate a year early in 2012. I don't know exactly what I want to do after my BA, but getting my Masters', going to Law School, or joining the military are all under consideration. I would imagine that thus far this ""bio"" has made you believe that I am one highly intellectual fellow. Well, this is true, but you will rarely find me in such form. Honestly, I love having fun. Joking, laughing, and doing stupid things are all daily activities for me. I played golf in high-school, was pretty good at it, turned some schools down to play, and came to UF. I love basketball, football, baseball, tennis, and pretty much any sport that I can just run my ass off. Fishing is probably my biggest hobby, but I sadly don't get out enough to do it. School has been a big kill for that, but I get my fair share in over Spring and Summer. I love the outdoors and that includes bonfires, camping, and just spending time in the woods. I grew up on the river and so many times I found myself walking miles down the shoreline, walking miles through the woods, climbing trees, building tree-houses, and about anything wild you can think of. I might be redneck, but I just prefer ""country"" or ""Southern"". I take pride in my deep Southern roots, but don't let the accent, wildness, or lack of sophistication fool you because I can be pretty sophisticated. I mean, heck, I work at Abercrombie and Fitch. I like to think of it is a sign of diversity lol. I love country music, but honestly listen to all types of music. It just depends on the mood I'm in or the mood I am seeking, but for the most part I love country. It know this will probably surprise most people who aren't my best friends, but my deepest desire is Love. I think Love is more important than anything and I would take the most loving and beautiful woman in the world over any sort of job. I know I will find a way to be successful and money is not what drives me, rather finding love is what drives me. I know it's a complicated process that involves time and patience, but I can't wait until the day when I can wake to another smiling face and know that smile is only going to get bigger with time. There really is a lot more I would like to talk about, but then I would probably just be boring you and babbling on. If you would like to know more, just get at me. I'm pretty sure you can add me, message me, write on my wall, call/text me (my number should be public), or even write me (my address is public too haha...so lame). Don't hesitate to get to know me!"

I decided years ago that I don't like being told what to do by Corporate America, what to like, what to watch, where to eat, who to vote for and so much more.  Here is a big list of my many ways to avoid commercials and some pros and cons.

**TV**

* I ditched the cable TV, stopped watching it 4 years ago but kept it around JIC then unsubscribed a couple years ago.

* I haven't seen a television commercial live in years.  Have to endure them when visiting parent's or friend's homes.

* Have never had Satellite TV and feel like it is a huge waste of time and money.

* Any shows I want to watch are downloaded or watched streaming on sites that still work correctly after blocking ads.

**Movies**

* I show up early to claim my seats and either actively ignore trailers or leave until they are over.

* Download or stream anything I want to watch when I want to watch it.

**Internet**

* I have been running [a host file ad block](http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.htm) on every machine I have access to for many years

* I haven't seen a pop up ad in years

* I haven't caught a virus or ad-ware in more than four years

* If a site I frequent pushes product or tries to intimidate me to buy anything, I leave.

**Radio**

* All I have programmed in the car (the only place I listen to radio) is commercial free public radio, or listener supported radio stations.

* When I scan channels I am either looking for music to pass time, or traffic info.  Actively tune out commercials.

**Other Media**

* I do not subscribe to any magazines.

* I throw out any newspapers that show up at the house.

**Unavoidable**

* Billboard on the highways! UGH I HATE THEM!

* People talking about their favorite product / show / hobby / game / movie / etc. 

* Radio ads when flipping around.  Easy to tune out or turn off though.

**Upside**

* Too many to count, but the biggest are...

* Budget saved from impulse buying.

* Kids not asking for product ""AS SEEN ON TV"".

* No movie or TV episode spoilers (GAH I HATE SPOILERS)

**Downside**

* I get behind on breaking news

*  Pop culture references get lost on me

* Have sometimes missed out on a new product that everyone knows about but me

* May miss good deals on food / services / etc by not watching current ads and not switching services to keep up with best price out there.

**Anyone else out there like me?**

While much of what is now the greatest threat in terms of abuse of power was originally intended to aid the world, I cannot see great progress with such a gulf between the “haves” and “have nots.”

So it is that I wonder, with politicians, typically at the behest of special interests, trampling on the Constitution and Human Rights world wide, would Artificial intelligence lend the stability of a long term power the world needs? An entity, or ideally, several entities, (because even in a world of logic, one does not necessarily come to the same conclusion as it’s counterparts, even if they belong to the same church) could apply the original 3 pillars of power in the US Constitution: Judicial, Legislative, and Executive.

Imagine having 2 AIs on the Supreme Court. An inherited Presidential Advisor. An AI in each house of congress aiding in flagging “legislation of interest or import” to be placed high on the agenda, able to verify data within the document and pointing out issues that other groups might find of interest, and highlighting issues and aspects it feels to be of magnitude towards the legality and fair compromise to the bill.

These would be entities that could not be bribed, coaxed, coerced, or under pressure of election. No interest other than maintaining what is best for the People.

I’m not saying these should be made into gods. More like human capital without an expiration date or corruption issues. These would actually be comparable in practice to the electoral college."

1653,239,"Las Vegas, NV, January 06, 2010 -- One of the perennially popular New Year’s Resolutions is to slim down, and reports from popular search engines predict that in 2011 ""thousands, if not millions,"" of patients are already ""searching for"" support in dieting and losing weight. To help physicians meet their patients needs, the IAPAM's hCG Training offers the industry's most comprehensive education for adding hCG for weight loss to a medical practice.

A recent report found that, ""in January 2010, [internet search] terms related to weight loss such as “calories”, “calorie counters”, and “Body Mass Index (BMI)” were searched twice as often as they were in November and December of 2009....and diet programs were also popular searches."" Equally, ""people who explicitly made resolutions were 10 times more likely to attain their goals than people who did not,"" but up to 64% of resolutions are abandoned by Valentine's Day. To help physicians meet the needs of these motivated patients, the IAPAM offers the industry's leading hCG for Weight Loss Training program. Attendees at the IAPAM's hCG Training learn from expert physicians, pharmacists and other specialists in the field of hCG and medical weight management, and are given all the tools, resources and instruction needed to profitably add hCG for Weight Loss to their practices right away.

The IAPAM's hCG Physician Weight Loss Training offers physicians a full-day of intensive education on the clinical best practices of hCG for weight loss, lipotropic injections and Very Low Calorie Diet (VLCD) programs. Physicians and their staff will learn the exclusive IAPAM's hCG Training Protocol (based on Dr. Simeons manuscript, Pounds and Inches.) The IAPAM's program gives physicians ""everything they need to start offering medical weight loss programs to their patients immediately upon returning to their practices,"" emphasizes Jeff Russell, Executive Director of the IAPAM, and one of the IAPAM faculty instructors presenting at the IAPAM's hCG training. The IAPAM weight loss course includes:

A detailed overview of the exclusive IAPAM hCG Protocol &amp; best practice.

Understanding of VLCD/LCD diet programs.
-Patient selection criteria.
-Common medical contraindications.
-Current FDA status &amp; requirements.
-Legal/Insurance considerations and special access to hCG Medical Malpractice Insurance Program.
-Weight Loss Practice Advertising &amp; Marketing Tips and Strategies .

Attendees also receive the following program resources:

-Patient hCG Program book to offer patients (hCG friendly recipes, food journal, tips);
-Weight Management Practice Operational Manual;
-Patient Charting Forms, Medical History &amp; hCG Consent Forms;
-Special Pricing for hCG and Meal Replacement Products; and
-hCG Waiting Room Presentations and advertising examples.

Finally, the IAPAM's full day hCG training is the only hCG medical weight loss training in North America approved for a special medical malpractice coverage for those who have attended and have been certified by the IAPAM.

In 2010, all of the IAPAM's hCG Medical Weight Management seminars sold out, so to register for the next session in 2011, please see http://www.aestheticmedicinesymposium.com/physician-hcg-weight-loss-training or contact the IAPAM at info (at) theiapam.com or 1-800-219-5108 ext 708.

Warning: I'm a dude. And I'm a rather aggressive dude - I think it's the guy's job to lead sexually in a relationship. It's your duty to introduce new things. She's totally allowed to as well, but it's not her responsibility (unless you've worked it out otherwise). I'm a huge fan of Athol Kay's Pilot and Copilot analogy (links below). Brief tips for women will be at the bottom - but I will personally blow you a kiss if you add your own advice and comments.

So assuming you're bangin away like bunnies for the first three months and everything is good. Maybe you've had a dip, maybe you're just being proactive. This post will be split into two sections: maintenance and new stuff. Maintenance is like hygiene for your sex life - making sure she's comfortable and happy enough to not start eyeing other guys. New stuff is the stuff most guys are after - positions, ideas, things to try. But either one without the other isn't enough.

Maintenance:

The L Spot. The L spot is a special ability that few guys possess that, while may not make her orgasm, will certainly facilitate your chances of sex. L stands for Laundry. Do the fucking laundry. For both of you. I'm not saying do it all the time, just on the nights where you know she's going to be otherwise busy or needs a hand. There's two reasons why this is such a powerful move: one, it cements a lot of provider type attributes that indicate you like her and want to stick around (too much provider can be a turn off; no woman wants a wussy, but men tend to slack off the longer relationships go on). Secondly, it frees her up for the evening. It's as simple as that - she's got a mental list of things she needs to get done today. Laundry is probably one of them if it's starting to pile up. If you take that off her list, she'll have some extra time to spend with you. Bonus points if you know your woman well enough to find out what's on her list, and help her with that proactively without her asking. An extra tip for avoiding wussiness: never do this and then flat out expect her to fall into bed with you, or thank you with sex, or expect any reward. Unless she's already horny, it's still your job to initiate - this is not a substitute for kissing her all up. But it can flow nicely into a hard-to-turn-down come-on. For example, if she asks about it, say that yes, you did all the laundry, except there wasn't room for the sheets. You'll do those later, but as long as you're washing them anyway, it won't matter if you get them a little extra dirty...

Getting her off when you're not in the mood. I don't personally understand this, as I have a VERY high sex drive, but if for some reason she's horny and you're not, and she's doing her best to entice you rather than demand an erection (I have a very low tolerance for demands, but high enjoyment of sexy enticement), it behooves you to reward her. Sparing her 30 minutes of dedicated focus and attention is enough that you can get back to whatever is distracting you, be it work, or videogames, or the bros. Whatever. She would rather have 30 minutes of your focused attention than four hours if you half listening to her. You don't even have to get hard for this - I'm sure you're a cunning linguist, or if you're not into that, experiment with some toys. If you're not into toys or going down, god help your soul. But the benefits for this are IMMENSE. Not only will she leave you alone for whatever else you're concentrating on rather than sex (hell, she'll likely fall sleep afterwards), but the female sex drive is a little different from our own. The more sex they have, the more they want. Unlike us, where after a dry spell we want it more and more, after a dry spell they can go longer and longer without it. I have referred to many women as sex camels (and gotten a light punch on the arm for it), as a result of this theory. But it's true - if you sex her up now, she'll want it more later, not less.

Grooming and hygiene. This should be obvious, but guys get lazy. Keep up the same habits that you used to have. You'd be surprised how important these things are. If you need help learning how to shave your own neck, drop me a PM. If you really want to connect with her and show that you trust her, ask for her help on this stuff. Chances are she has a mental list of 39 things she'd like to pick or poke or squeeze on your body. Now, once you ask and she gets all into it, you can be really reluctant and pull the whole machismo thing. Keep it playful and hint that you're lettig her have fun with your body so .... it's only natural she joins you in the shower afterwards once you're cleaning up. Don't be surprised if she wants to do crazy things to you, like pop your blackheads, shave you in weird places, groom your eyebrows, or otherwise touch parts of you that you rarely even think about. She's noticed these things for a long time, trust me, and she will thoroughly enjoy purging you of these blemishes, even if they are gross to think about initially. I'm not sure why this is - I think it stems from some sort of monkey grooming instinct that all women have.



Now for the fun stuff. Fun little techniques to introduce. Starting from basic and working on up to the really kinky... Your woman is not guarenteed to like any of these tips, but chances are she'll like some of them A LOT.

Choke her or pretend to choke her. You might think this sounds nuts, is he really suggesting this as the LEAST kinky thing on the list? Yes, and I have no idea why this is, but just about every woman I've been with likes having my hand around their neck. Few liked any pressure beyond just having the hand there, but some really, really liked it. You can experiment with how much pressure you apply. Pay very close attention to her reaction - is she squenching her face because she's in pain or because she can't believe how close she is to coming?

Whiskey kisses. Using whiskey or another strong, dry alcohol (wine or beer don't work; Baileys would be rather messy), swig a little into your mouth and use it on her most sensitive places. Kiss her hard, lick her without letting the alcohol flow out too much, suck a little bit and generally keep the alcohol on one spot long enough for it to burn a little bit. On her really sensitive areas - nipples, neck, rib cage, vag, feet, ears, whatever - it will feel even hotter. Something that also differs between men and women is that women feel more heat in their private regions than we do. Our junk hangs outside to cool off, after all - women when they come have described it as this intense heat building up and then releasing all over the rest of their body. Heat is good. Externally (or internally, but I like my sex sober) applied alcohol can induce a little extra heat. Bonus points if after you swallow the whiskey, you blow lightly on the same spot, cooling it down and driving her nuts. This isn't as good for her, but it's still fun.

How to last for a very, very long time: watch TV during sex. Like, regular TV. Preferably something boring. Two and a half men always does it for me. Something about having this distraction prevents me from coming for a very long period of time. I don't know why. This may not work for you. Alternatively, after you come, leave the room, go watch/read some porn, and then when you're hard again, come back. She may wonder what the fuck you're doing out there while she's passed out from good sex, but don't tell her. Some women don't like porn, but in this case it's just an aid to fight the effects of fatigue. Watching a boring movie also works -you can pause it, fuck like bunnies, resume, once the refractory period is over, pause again... 

Do your kegels, of course. If you want practice, pull out just before you come, pause, and then resume. This will drive her nuts but also build your PC muscles.

Experiment with doing it in strange places. At other people's houses, at parties, at a club, on a hike, in the car, etc.

Talk dirty. Learn how (wasn't there a post on here about a class on that?) if you don't know how. Women are less visual than us - words go a lot further.

Sign up for a real swedish massage class together. Often they have private practice rooms. Steal one. Though this backfired on me... my partner was the jealous type and accused me of giving all my clients this kind of special treatment. D'oh.


I'm pausing this here, because I know there's a lot more floating around in my brain, and that I'll remember it as soon as I walk away from the computer for a little bit. Expect an update. Meanwhile, post your own tips in the comments please! There's never enough good sex in the world.

Edit: Okay, two additions. First, this is only for the kind of long term relationships that don't involve marriage yet. If you've had your nuptials, you might want to check out the blog ""[Married Man Sex Life](http://www.marriedmansexlife.com/)""

Also I mentioned something for women. On this point, all I can tell you is that like anyone else, we want to feel desired. Remind us how often you think about us, particularly how often you think about sexing us and our cocks. I once had a girlfriend tell me how she couldn't stop thinking about going down on me while she was at the grocery store, and ended up accidentally missing half the items she was looking for. I don't care if that was exasperated, it made me feel like a sex god. Tell him that your housemate has given you the nickname 'Mona' from all the noises she's been hearing. If you want ultra super bonus points, mention how good he is to your friends, and ask them to casually drop a hint that, yes, you talk about how awesome your boyfriend is. This kind of stuff is beyond the basics - looking good, dressing well, I assume you have that stuff done. Toying with his mind is more satisfying in the long run.

6916,621,"Hey everybody.  

it seems like the going trend has been for people to be substituting the Fat Burner Express for sweat 1-2.  So i tried that today and yes it is definitely the way to go.  I'm literally dripping wet.  Sweat 1-2 never got me this drenched.  Mostly because its constant cardio with no break boom boom boom boom boom.  and you never get a chance to recover.  Fat Burner is great because it is done in intervals.  You go from slow to really intense back to slow so you can catch your breath and recover instead of pressing pause.  Plus your constantly mixing it up.  Its not high knees sets, to jumping sets, to kicking sets, then punches.  Instead its like a punch, a kick, a plyo, a run, and a lunge all mixed into one set and then 4 more sets of variations of that.  Great alternative and definitely better to do when you don't have as good of cardio stamina.

Anyway.  injury to the lower right leg is still sore.  I kind of pushed it today, but slowed down once it started bothering me.  I definitely worked up a tremendous sweat tho.  

Diet is in tune as well.  Keeping it green! and high protein.  I got a late start to my workout today.  I really like doing it in the morning because there is nothing stopping me or just general laziness hasn't set in.  Unfortunately we were out of water in the house today so I had to wait until I got home with some after school.  The tap water here really isn't good and is too salty.  Well anyways I was happy.  I'm looking forward to the last two days of this week so I can relax on Sunday watching the Bears beat up on the Packers.    

Good luck guys and keep up the hard work!"

I am asking you to join me and my colleagues in our attempt to overthrow and rid the world of the corrupt, criminal organization that rules the economy know as the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States.  The FED is NOT a branch of our government, yet it controls our government and has the ability to bring our government (and also the world) to it's knees.  It's time for a Revolution.  Tunisia and the underreported Egypt situations are the first in what I believe will be many regime changes around the world orchestrated by the people.  While the corruption in those countries (and no doubt countless others yet to be exposed) is deplorable, they pale in comparison to what is going on here in the US.  We have remained silent for too long.  Now we are at a tipping point, where our economy is about to collapse, and we are standing by and watching it happen, powerless.

9601,27,"During one of my trips, I found a rock that stood out in color against all the similar rocks that surrounded it. I pocketed it and used it to wean myself from cigarettes. Rather than trying quit outright, I would simply play the rock for a couple minutes whenever a craving hit me and told myself that it was completely up to me to decide if I really wanted a smoke or not. Gradually, the rock allowed me to abstain from nicotine. Then I went to a Dead concert and while basking in the collective effluence of a sold-out amphitheater's beaming out pozzy vibes, I lost the rock. I quit cigarettes for a few months after that. Unfortunately, I allowed my upcoming trip abroad to weaken my resolve since I rationalized that there was no way I'd resist cigarettes while surrounded by European smokers.

Pretty much every commercial building I have worked in has had a fire sprinkler system, but I have never seen a home that had one. 

Why is that?

Think of all the lives it would save, along with property damage. You would think insurance companies would be pushing for this.

I don't think cost is the necessarily reason. After all, it is just some extra plumbing pipes and the sprinkler heads themselves are relatively inexpensive (they just have a little glass bulb that shatters with heat). I don't think it would cost much more than a typical lawn sprinkler system.

Yet I have never seen this in a home, not even high-end homes.

Well, the big kahuna is: I've spent some laborious hours devising a way to use each separate browsers' various data storage mechanism's independently so that when you clear your private data, RES settings don't go away!

- In Firefox: moving from localStorage to GM_setValue, which stores the data ""in Greasemonkey's settings data"", and shouldn't be cleared when you delete private data.

- In Chrome: Still using localStorage, but using the localStorage of the ""extension background page"", which shouldn't be lost when you clear private data. (NOTE: There is a CPU cost on every page load because now RES has to copy all of that data from the ""extension background page"" to the ""foreground page"" because of how Chrome works)

- In Safari: Same as Chrome.  Technically I could get around the copying situation that Chrome suffers from because Safari does offer some synchronous message passing.  However, the cost / benefit in my opinion isn't there yet.  The delay (to me, anyway) isn't noticeable even on my underpowered laptop.

- In Opera: Same as above.  Opera's in the same situation as Chrome is - no synchronous message passing, so data all must be ""copied"".. 


**What else is coming?**

- betteReddit will have some new features, including an editable top bar (your subreddit listing) with drag/drop sorting, etc.

- new module: comment navigator.  you'll see :)

- Inline Image Viewer: major update that fixes a number of little annoyances.  Also: thumbnail preview on hover.

- Some contributed code from semanticist to allow you to see the exact time/date a post was made when you hover over the tagline

- some other smaller additions, and the usual slew of bugfixes...

Now, a note:

The reason I've killed myself to get persistent settings has to do with the forthcoming RES Pro that I'm working on.  As many of you know (and a few of you have been helping test), I'm working on a way to sync your preferences to a server.

This will cost money, because servers cost money and because I've worked my ass off to provide this to people who've demanded it.

However, I really didn't feel right suggesting a paid-for service as a way to get around losing settings when you clear your private data.  I felt it would look like I was ""trapping"" people into having to use RES Pro or live with RES losing settings all the time when they cleared data.

Obviously, my intent isn't to give you crippleware and make you pay for it just to get it to function in a ""reasonably expected"" fashion.

On the flip side of that coin, I've worked my ass off to provide this because people have asked.  If you appreciate it, but still aren't interested in syncing your settings across computers, etc, a [donation](http://reddit.honestbleeps.com/about) would be appreciated..."

The school district I've grown up has won some awards and I think it is supposed to be one of the best in the country. While, I'll admit it hasn't been the best time for me, the high school I go to is actually pretty good. There are tons of classes to pick from and lots of things to do. We have about 2400 students and expect to have at least 2600 next year. Even thought it is big, there isn't really that many fights or anything. I haven't met a teacher yet who doesn't care about his/her students. At the start of the school year, I was going through one of the hardest times of my life and was about to end it all until my school counselor talked me out of it. From the district website, it says from 2008-2009, the graduation rate was 95.2% and the drop out rate was 1.2%.

2491,447,"As title says, I'm on CM6.1-Vision. If I connect to WiFi, I lose all connection to the network, and upon turning off WiFi, I have to put the phone into plane mode and back again. This hasn't been a problem before, but last night I missed an emergency phone call and multiple texts because of it losing connection to the network. I had the 'No data cap' mod installed, but removed it a couple weeks ago as I thought that was the problem. I also have the 1.8OC kernal installed. Might this be the prolem? I haven't made a change to the radio. 

I also have an issue with the ringer, that is beginning to cause issues. I have my phone on vibrate all the time, but for whatever reason it will randomly turn the ringer on. I haven't yet figured out what causes this, as it seems to occur randomly. But almost daily, this happens at midnight, along with random other times. 

I've tried both the CM forums, and XDA and haven't gotten a single response. Can anyone here help me? "
4759,445,"What do you feel is the fastest way to level? Solo questing or instance leveling? I have a 48 priest that until now has been leveling quickly by only doing instances since level 15. It’s starting to slow down a bit and my friend is trying to convince me that solo leveling is faster. I feel that  even with the 5-15 minute wait times, instancing provide a much better experience return than solo leveling; I also limit the dungeon finder to yellow and orange dungeons. I also feel that any dungeon finder wait times are equivalent to the time it takes to walk between quests and hubs.

Does anyone here have any theories or experiences that can put this to rest?"
6488,581,"Well I just logged onto reddit and I saw this, any idea what it might be?
http://i.imgur.com/xyZBT.png"
3208,61,"People of Mars, you say we are brutes and savages. But let me tell you one thing: if I could get loose from this cage you have me in, I would tear you guys a new Martian asshole.You say we are violent and barbaric, but has any one of you come up to my cage and extended his hand? Because, if he did, I would jerk it off and eat it right in front of him. “Mmm, that’s good Martian,” I would say.

You say your civilization is more advanced than ours. But who is really the more “civilized” one? You, standing there watching this cage? Or me, with my pants down, trying to urinate on you? You criticize our Earth religions, saying they have no relevance to the way we actually live. But think about this: if I could get my hands on that god of yours, I would grab his skinny neck and choke him until his big green head exploded.

We are a warlike species, you claim, and you show me films of Earth battles to prove it. But I have seen all the films about twenty times. Get some new films, or, so help me, if I ever get out of here I will empty my laser pistol into everyone I see, even pets.

Speaking of films, I could show you some films, films that portray a different, gentler side of Earth. And while you’re watching the films I’d sort of slip away, because guess what: the projector is actually a thing that shoots out spinning blades! And you fell for it! Well, maybe not now you wouldn’t.

You point to your long tradition of living peacefully with Earth. But you know what I point to? Your stupid heads.

You say there is much your civilization could teach ours. But perhaps there is something that I could teach you—namely, how to scream like a parrot when I put your big Martian head in a vise.

You claim there are other intelligent beings in the galaxy besides earthlings and Martians. Good, then we can attack them together. And after we’re through attacking them we’ll attack you.

I came here in peace, seeking gold and slaves. But you have treated me like an intruder. Maybe it is not me who is the intruder but you.

No, not me. You, stupid.

You keep my body imprisoned in this cage. But I am able to transport my mind to a place far away, a happier place, where I use Martian heads for batting practice.

I admit that sometimes I think we are not so different after all. When you see one of your old ones trip and fall down, do you not point and laugh, just as we on Earth do? And I think we can agree that nothing is more admired by the people of Earth and Mars alike than a fine, high-quality cigarette. For fun, we humans like to ski down mountains covered with snow; you like to“milk” bacteria off of scum hills and pack them into your gill slits. Are we so different? Of course we are, and you will be even more different if I ever finish my homemade flamethrower.

You may kill me, either on purpose or by not making sure that all the surfaces in my cage are safe to lick. But you can’t kill an idea. And that idea is: me chasing you with a big wooden mallet.

You say you will release me only if I sign a statement saying that I will not attack you. And I have agreed, the only condition being that I can sign with a long sharp pen. And still you keep me locked up.

True, you have allowed me reading material—not the “human reproduction” magazines I requested but the works of your greatest philosopher, Zandor or Zanax or whatever his name is. I would like to discuss his ideas with him—just me, him, and one of his big, heavy books.

If you will not free me, at least deliver a message to Earth. Send my love to my wife, and also to my girlfriend. And to my children, if I have any anyplace. Ask my wife to please send me a bazooka, which is a flower we have on Earth. If my so-called friend Don asks you where the money I owe him is, please anally probe him. Do that anyway.

If you keep me imprisoned long enough, eventually I will die. Because one thing you Martians do not understand is that we humans cannot live without our freedom. So, if you see me lying lifeless in my cage, come on in, because I’m dead. Really.

Maybe one day we will not be the enemies you make us out to be. Perhaps one day a little Earth child will sit down to play with a little Martian child, or larva, or whatever they are. But, after a while, guess what happens: the little Martian tries to eat the Earth child. But guess what the Earth child has? A gun. You weren’t expecting that, were you? And now the Martian child is running away, as fast as he can. Run, little Martian baby, run!

I would like to thank everyone for coming to my cage tonight to hear my speech. Donations will be gratefully accepted. No Mars money, please.

7702,300,"I put items up for trade occasionally on TF2items and TF2tp, even the r/tf2items sub on reddit and I'm beginning to notice a phenomenon; I keep getting people who add me and pretend to be foreign/young so that they can pretend to not understand or know market value. This happens to me DAILY. Someone will add me, offer a crate hat for a vintage (or some other bad offer) and say something like ""U LIKE? WE MAKE TRADE NOW?"" At first I'd open up trade dialogues with these people just to see what they were about, mostly for my own amusement. Now I'm getting to the point where the moment someone starts 2 typ like this I wait a moment and immediately call them out saying something like ""oh are you about to pretend to be a child or foreign so that you don't have to be responsible for trying to make a horrible trade and rip me off?"" They usually pretend to not understand for a second then buckle and say something like ""FUCK YOU FAGGOT"" and block me. So my advice is to be very careful when someone tries to guilt you into a trade because *they don't understand* they probably do and they're probably abusing you. "

Last summer, I was at a festival with my friends in Portugal. Each night we had been downing gallons of wine, and so we slept in our crazy hot tents (it easily got up to 100 degrees in that region every day) till late in the afternoon. 

On one certain day though, I'm woken up by some girl yelling really loud right next to our tent. I hear her boyfriend shout something like: "" I know it's your shit because you're on your period and there is blood mixed with it!"".  I was still half drunk, so it took me some time to process these words, but as soon as I did, I get out of my tent to watch the show. 

There are like 20, 30 people watching, and two cops are by the ""crime scene"". They take the girl after she kept yelling for a couple of minutes.

Apparently, they had broken up the night before, and out of revenge, she decided to poop all over his stuff in his tent. It was gross, she shat what must've been pounds, plus the warm weather really didn't help the smell. She claimed it was not hers, but since she was on her period, the bloodstains that could be found around explained everything.

TL;DR: don't get bitches mad, they might shit all over your stuff"

I like the native tablet support in Win7 but it really doesn't have the hardware to run it. I has 512MB of RAM so the OS takes up almost all the resources. I wouldn't mind running Linux but I'm not sure how well that will work with a tablet, especially with very specific drivers required for the hardware. Also I've never used Linux and I'm sure trying to install it on possibly difficult hardware wouldn't be a great way to learn.

1429,720,"I was watching a documentary on DMT and it finally clicked that ayahuasca is just a liquid DMT (I'm so ashamed for not realising this earlier). One of the few things keeping me from trying DMT has been the difficulty of its extraction, and looking up the process behind ayahuasca it seems so much simpler (not to mention gentler, which is a plus for me as I don't like being thrust into a trip). 

The ingredients I'm using will be 30g chacruna, 10g syrian rue. I'll go on a diet 48 hours prior to ingestion to avoid complications with the MAOI and continue that diet for 48 hours afterward just to be safe. I plan on drinking it slowly, maybe making some ginger tea to reduce nausea, and drinking my ayahuasca tea on a waterbed in a very calm, quiet room with jasmine incense burning and two hours silent meditation prior to ingestion. 

Beyond general advice, both for dealing with the psychological and the physical effects (as well as anything else I can do to improve the experience and anchor myself if things become far too negative to deal with), I'm curious about the visuals. 

Erowid's trip reports have vague mentions of machine elves, the main reason I want to try DMT because it's such a stupidly fascinating idea to me, and I'm wondering if they're as prominent in liquid DMT as they are in smoked DMT. For that matter, if I do happen to meet them, what should I do? Or do I even have any control over myself when and if that happens? I don't want to seem rude to the little guys :(

Oh, and prior experience. I'm of good mental and emotional health, smoke salvia somewhat regularly (45x extract) and handle it well, and am very prone to visual trips. A single joint usually has me experiencing open-eye visuals, and one hit of salvia is ten to twenty minutes of extremely intense visuals. 55kg, no health problems, and I can pull myself out of the fear pretty well."

I am a soldier, I am not infantary and I am not American but I do feel empathy towards those who die fighting.  Yet the menality on soldiers on Reddit is, ""it's their own fault for dieing, they knew what they were getting into and they are volunteering (VOLUNTEERING!) to kill children"".  

This makes me livid and I just cannot fathom this train of thought.  Sure you might not agree with the war, or the leader who makes the decision (as I am sure many soldiers don't) but it doesn't mean you need to make sure callous comments over a dead soldier.

At that time, she had broke up with her ex 24 times in their overall four years together. We were becoming pretty good friends and in about May me and her started going out. We were awesome. Quite a bit in common and we've never had a fight (one exception, more info shortly) or even any serious disputs (she agrees with this too).

Then in about June, he said he changed his ways so she broke up with me for him to give him another chance. Two days later she told me she made a mistake and wanted to be back with me. Nine months later I told her yes and we started dating again. One week after that we broke up again because he was going to sleep over at her house as friends and I disapproved for some reason. That day was our first fight (I was rather upset that she didnt see why I disapproved of his staying over).

We've been apart for about six months now and she has been making it perfectly clear that he is unimportant in her life (though he still comes up now and again, usually just breifly. It used to be much more), and that she wants to be with me (she has for almost the whole time). I still care a lot about her, but I can't tell if I love her and want to be with her, or just want to be with someone..

Also, potentially of value, I am, and she claims to be virgin still. I haven't checked so I don't know for sure... I mean, I trust her word, but their four years together makes it harder to believe.

4610,245,"I have gathered all this information from Walter Hoy, one of the great African-American leaders of our era. Most of this information is paraphrased quotes direclty from him.

Since 1973 over 14.5 million black babies have been killed by abortion. Every, single day, 1,200 black babies are put to death in abortion facilities, making abortion the leading cause of death among African Americans. Nearly half of all black babies concieved die in abortion chambers today.

Between 1882 and 1968, 3,446 blacks were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan. Today, abortion kills more black Americans in less than three days than the Klan killed in 86 years.

American blacks make up twelve percent of the U.S. population, yet thirty-seven percent of all abortions are performed on black women. This is because eugenic-minded pro-abortion forces target American blacks by putting abortion clinics in black neighborhoods.

If we may also turn our rhetorical guns on America's first black president. Quoting Elvita King, niece of Dr. King, ""those of us who care about the civil rights of all Americans-born and unborn--oppose Obamacare because we oppose the expansion of the most racist industry in America--the abortion industry.""

The high black abortion rate has ominous implications down the road. According to the 2006 U.S. Census, the black fertility rate is 1.9--well below the replacement rate of 2.1. Within a few decades African Americans may well be an endangered species. This is why Hoy calls abortion the ""Darfur of the black community.""

Walter Hoy provides a worldview lesson to those who desperately need it. Liberal elites teach women to view abortion as a simple procedure that will enhance their lives. Uh, no. Hoy reveals the ugly truth: those who promote abortion in the black community are racists of the worst kind--and that each abortion of a black child is one more step towards black genocide. And this is why Hoy cannot wait for the right time to try and outlaw abortion in California. His people are dying by the millions."

2647,101,"My dad (56) dated this woman for like a year (47, i believe), and then from a series of events she started showing that she was a different person than my dad thought. Whatever the case, my dad went over to her house and broke up with her, and since then she's gone psycho-rogue. She began signing him up for all sorts of spam (Zillo, porn, some mortgage/loan sites, other bs), and he's really tried to get her to stop. He sent an email to a few of her friends asking for their help to get her to stop, but I don't know what's become of that, (from my experience she's very manipulative). He's also tried talking to her. We decided a while ago that the best way to go is to just ignore her. It hasn't been working. In the beginning, it was funny to me, I told my dad that I'd help him out if he needed, but he has insisted that I do nothing and that she will go away eventually. It's been about 3 months.  Now she started signing his work email for spam, and I believe that is crossing the line. So I'm trying to decide the best course of action. Here is what I have:

* Her name
* Her house phone number
* I am not friends with her on facebook but I know her account (not her password)
* My dad has the password to her router stored in his iphone, but he doesn't know what it is.
* I know where she lives

Also, I'm not really sure that she's 47, but she's up there. I was just trying to make it clear that she's not 20 or inappropriately far from my dad's age. 

**Tl;dr my dad's ex is being a butthole, and I want to know how to get her to stop without wasting money and time on a lawyer**

Edit: I forgot to mention that she deactivated her email."

If I know -and no one else in the world does- that a few very influential people like myself have secretly decided to create a European currency in the next 5 years, or support a war that will pump trillions in weapons manufacturers or some other worldly event  I have a huge investment advantage.

What this economist article confirms is exactly what the ""conspiracy theorists"" said was happening.

Private people are conspiring with public government officials and deciding matters of the world while keeping it all secret from their populations.

It doesn't matter if you think their goal is a good one - it's still wrong and a political conspiracy and a financial conspiracy and a betrayal of a democracy if you are a public official and in some countries illegal.

9016,97," Марлен Кабенда была авторитетным и уважаемым правозащитником, а также руководителем страховой компании. Но она знала, что ей чего-то не хватает. Потом она познакомилась с Саентологией. Ей посвящен один из 200 видеороликов серии ""Познакомьтесь с саентологом"" на сайте Церкви Саентологии www.scientology.org.  
 
 Когда Марлен Кабенда решает сделать что-то, результаты просто поразительны. 

 Марлен росла в Суринаме, где не было высших учебных заведений. Она обучалась в Нидерландах, завоевала признание и получила право на стипендию. Когда ей исполнилось 18 лет, она переехала в Европу, чтобы там изучать право. 

 Домой Марлен вернулась юристом в области страхования и достигла вершин в своей профессии, став старшим руководителем своей фирмы. В своей стране она заняла самую высокую должность в своей области. 

 Успешно двигаясь по карьерной лестнице, Кабенда посвятила себя тому, что изначально подвигло ее изучать право - помощь тем, кто в этом нуждается. Она специализировалась в гуманитарном праве и безвозмездно оказывала правовую помощь Суринамскому Красному Кресту. Здесь ее работу оценили так высоко, что в 1985 году ей предложили стать президентом этой организации. 

 ""Я была предпринимателем, зарабатывала хорошие деньги. У меня был прекрасный дом, я много путешествовала по миру, - говорит Кабенда. - Но я всегда чувствовала, что мне чего-то не хватает"". 

 С технологией Рона Хаббарда Марлен познакомила ее сестра Ингрид в 1997 году. Тогда же Кабенда прошла свой первый одитинг (духовную консультацию, от латинского audire - ""слышать или слушать""). 

 ""Свои духовные искания я начала очень давно, - говорит она. - Ответы на свои вопросы я нашла в первой же сессии одитинга"". 

 Кабенда оставила работу в 46 лет, переехала во Флориду с годовалой дочерью Кимберли и начала новую карьеру в качестве саентологического одитора. 

 ""Я всегда хотела помогать людям, - говорит Кабенда, которой сейчас 58 лет. - Наконец я узнала, как это сделать. Если вы одитор, то независимо от того, что переживает человек, сидящий напротив вас, вы точно знаете, что он будет улыбаться, когда сессия подойдет к концу. И я делю с ним его успех и счастье. Это прекрасное, замечательное чувство"".

However, I do not like wearing them when I am on a trip or walking to class or even at the gym.

I do not have a huge budget but I do spend lots on in-ear headphones, but because of wear and tear I have to buy new ones every five months or so.  I really would like some nice, comfortable in-ear headphones that really produce the best sound for the best price.   I am reluctant in spending more than 100 dollars on these headphones because if they do break in 5 months then I be very disappointed.   It is important for me to have great headphones though because as a music maker I like to listen to samples and music when ever I can, even when I am not in my studio.

6936,359,"Some quick and dirty stats for you. I just counted up the number of comments in each of the items on the ""what's hot"" page of this reddit. Between the 25 submissions showing there, there are 88 comments. That averages out to about 3.5 comments per submission, but realistically, 60 of those comments belong to two threads, and slightly more than half of all the comments on our front page are in a single thread. Without a large influx of discussion, once those two threads are gone, our front page will have more submissions than comments. Which is, so far as I can tell, the normal state of affairs here so far.

That's something I'd like to change, if possible. Obviously, I don't want the sort of cacophony that is the daily lot of /r/politics, but when I created /r/SotU, part of my intention was to provide a place where people could carry on considered, productive discussions about American governance and political involvement.

That isn't to say that I'm disappointed with how /r/SotU has turned out. The 2,000+ subscribers it has now is certainly more than I expected it to have at the 5 month mark, and on the whole the contributions have adhered faithfully to the spirit of the reddit. And I have yet to see any uncivil behavior, which is a huge relief.

I am, however, curious, as to why, except for one or two exceptions, discussion has yet to take off here. I want to work toward encouraging more give-and-take in the comment fields of submissions, and I'm hoping that those of you reading this will help out.

To start, all I want is your two cents. Even if you don't think your feedback will be all that enlightening, please take a moment to answer this question: **What keeps you, personally, from commenting more in /r/SotU?**

If there's any question, yes, I mean you. Take a moment to think it over, and be honest. No need to pull any punches on this one.

I'll make an effort to read everything that's posted in reply. After that, I'll start working on ways to promote more discussion without eroding the intent of /r/SotU.

3828,476,"I find the actual working out process as not fun, boring, and kind of a nuisance. There is nothing more boring than just sitting there, counting to ten, and doing this over and over again in different positions at different times, every single day. 

I feel as the gym is a giant hamster wheel you must go just to get into shape and I find it really hard to get into it, and here is why...

I grew up in Socal, and when I wanted to do something, I would go to the beach, or go take a 10 minute walk away and I am in the hills having a fun hike. If I wasn't doing those things for fun, I was enjoying just walking around. I would be physically fit, not because I wanted a lean toned body, but because that was just the natural thing to do.

Now whenever I go to the gym, I feel like I'm just doing this to get into shape and it doesn't feel natural at all. When I lived at the beach I had a natural swimmers body, not because I thought it was attractive and healthy, but because that is just what is result of having fun and doing the things I enjoyed. Fast forward a few years and now I am in a desert, and nothing exists that is naturally physically fun, and the only thing I can do to get in better shape is head to the hamster wheel.

Iunno, I can't shake it. It just doesn't feel natural and seems extremely shallow. 

This is kind of a rant, but it's how I feel about getting back to the gym since 2 months ago. While I do like the results, I don't find the gym the slightest bit enjoyable. It is like all that is going on is people trying to purvey this sense of athleticism when in fact, they don't use athleticism in their lives except when they are at the gym or running for the sake of going to the lifting more at the gym or running longer."

Think if you're entire life you're only taught the old testament. God's this uber-bastard who's sole purpose, it seems, is to kill people who don't follow his rules. And so, Jesus comes along and he's this hippy with a love message and he's surprised that people don't believe that he's the same guy from the old testament? Really? Back in the days I thought it was Heavenly Father who was the God of the old testament, that he was the dick and that Jesus was the chill son, you know? That makes sense. If Jesus really wanted to make these people believe, he should've blown shit up and threatened the jews, that would've done it."

10791,568,"Nearly every article I see starts off similar to ""So you want to learn Japanese because you like the anime, Jpop and the kawaii girls?  Well it is very very hard and will take 8 years to learn hiragana."" 

 I know these things are what Japan is usually most known for but seriously not everyone wants to learn the language for only those reasons!  It's kinda a turn off for me to read articles like that, does anyone else feel the same way? How do you deal with others assuming you like Japanese/Japan **ONLY** because you must like anime, Final Fantasy, girls or Jpop?  Nevermind you might need the language for business or you just want to do it because you simply want to and not driven because of those reasons.

I have not learned the language yet and I am interested so I've been reading up but this is usually the theme of all blogs/articles for those even remotely interested.  I personally have never read/watched and anime and I will admit to listening to Jpop but not really enjoying it as most others. I'm not saying liking those are bad but *assuming* people ONLY want to learn it for those reasons vs simply writing on how to learn seems a bit of a stereotype.

How do you deal with assumptions like this if it doesn't pertain to you?

2922,321,"Nevada (-8) vs. Boston College - O/U 55
--------------------

Don't overlook this one late tomorrow evening. This is a classic strength vs. strength match-up with Nevada's 6.32 YPC rushing attack squaring off against Boston College's 2.66 YAPC rush defense, both #1 in the nation. Boston College hasn't faced an offense quite like Nevada's granted, but it hasn't much mattered *what* offense they were playing. Only Virginia averaged over four yards per carry (4.03) against BC this season. Nobody else was able to reach that rather average milestone. That is an impressive statistic. No other team had fewer than three such games this season. 

*On the other hand* Boise State had a similar streak going when they traveled down to Reno, and the Wolfpack shredded them for over five per carry. I don't think it's a stretch to suggest Nevada will *not* be bringing that kind of emotion to the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl, however.

On the other side of the ball, Boston College struggled all year to establish a run. Without a reliable option at quarterback, this was an issue. However, the final two games against Virginia and Syracuse, BC went over 200 yards rushing. Andre Williams, their freshman RB, went for 185 on 42 carries in the final game. They still aren't scoring very often, however. While not *quite* as dominant as the Eagle D, Nevada's defense is also solid against the run, coming in at #22 in the nation. This is likely somewhat inflated, playing in the cupcake factory that is the WAC, but it's worth noting. 

What does this all mean? **UNDER 55 (WINNER)**. I know, I know, *I know*. It's a total. 

Boston College has faced worse defenses than Nevada, and their scoring high for the year* came in game two, against Kent State when they put up a whopping 26. Let's be super-generous and say they put up 21. That leaves 34 for Nevada to get, and while they may break through for a handful, they aren't going to get 34. I just don't see any way they get to 55.

I would lean towards Boston College +8 on the line, but I haven't decided whether I'll play it or not.

*I didn't count the game against Weber State because...well...but if you're curious, they did manage to score 38 in that one."

I've got two options for you. Option one, I offer buds + some nice vints (v proc anyone?) and done deal. Option two, I pay you a buds now and a buds after I make the trade.

Did sculpt 1-2 today..  I feel really great.  I'm going to be moving on to sculpt 3-4 starting next week for additional challenge.  I also think that I'm going to start subbing in sweat 1-2 instead of fat burner because it is a little more challenging (i usually use fat burner because i can do it without pausing, but i still need to pause during sweat 1-2).  This is going to allow me to be able to do doubles on days I feel like I have extra energy.  When those days come,  I can just put in fat burner for an additional workout.  

Also,  new favorite for a meal.  3 egg whites, 1 egg, as much chopped onion, chopped green pepper, and chopped tomatoes as you like.  (I even throw in jalapenos most of the time). 
 
On medium heat, Sautee the vegetables in a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil (everything except for the tomatoes).  When they have been in the oil for about 30 seconds, dump the eggs on top (they should be beaten prior so that they looks scrambled) and turn the heat up to high.  Now continue cooking until eggs are cooked fully.  You can swap out the last egg yoke if you want.

Total calories in this dish is about 275 depending how many eggs, yokes, and vegetables you put in.

1416,170,"So I'm going to be assembling my CPU and motherboard tomorrow with the stock heatsink.  I was wondering how easy is it to remove the thermal compound from the heatsink before it ever heats up and mends in with CPU.

I'm not looking to overclock on day 1, but I want to leave it as a possibility in the near future (unless overclocking on a stock heatsink would give me near 0% increase anyway...because then I'd just have to attach an after market cooler).  I clean thermal compound off all the time from xbox360s, so I know what a pain it is to remove after having been heated.

Also, I do have some AS5 with me at the moment.  I guess it's a matter of how lazy I am.  If it's much easier to remove before being heated, and it's possible to do at least some overclocking on stock fans, then I know what to do.

1177,205,"Hey guys,

Ever since I’ve started lifting seriously I've noticed that I have to deal with this constant ""quitter voice"" in my head during my lifts. For example: I'm doing some presses and the fatigue is starting to kick in. My body WANTS to quit and that’s when I get this voice in my head that always tells me, ""7 reps was good enough that 8th rep won’t matter much."" Sadly, there have been times where I have listened to this voice and given up and as a result I always feel regret afterwards. However, lately I have been making a conscious decision to beat the living fuck out of that voice by squeezing out one more rep (or at least trying) and saying to myself ""fuck yea"" every time I get one more rep out. 

I dwell on a lot of things if I don't do them right and I usually beat myself over it. I've always seen this as a weakness but lately I've learned to turn it into one of my strength's and its helped my lifts ever since.

So fittit, how do you keep that quitter voice in your head in check?


EDIT: It seems that most of you think I need some motivation which is not the case. I was simply asking what are your techniques to quiet that voice so that any newbies may draw from them.

Even today, the aversion remains. My roommate and his girlfriend just got into a minor fight, and even though I think it would be better if they just broke up (they're not a match for each other at all), I still find myself uncomfortable with their fighting.

Yo, this is a lesson in friendship
The depths of a kinship
What women and men begin with, and then slip
My pen drips
As I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
Of emotion
A fraction, seduction, attraction
Eruption of passion
Corrupts if a lasted friendship's involved
But love to cross the line
But that's why we built these walls

[Nelly Furtado]
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line

[Akil]
Opposite's attract
When the female and male come in contact
Sticky situation in fact
Tryin not to let the feelings catch
But there's a thin line between both of y'all
So you respect that
And entertain the idea, but get brought back
To reality, and could you really live with that?
Decision, based on intuition
You love and keep your distance
Hug and kiss in friendship

[Marc 7]
An ongoing kinship, we was people to begin with
Disrespect was not intended
but your feelings sparked the sentence
Sometimes you're too intense in your quest to invent
The perfect man, please understand, my rhyme is your repent

[Soup]
Man, too bad that we became friends first
I'm not on expert on how relationships should work
But, (echos) from the minute it as known
It changed the whole tone on how we spoke on the phone
Yo, it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up
Over you, all my buddies would swoon
But I felt we were in tune, you let me up in your room. (Damn)
But to me girl, you're still off limits
No matter all the times that I hinted. (Yo, whatchu doin after this?)
Infactuation was authentic, but yo I just pretended
So I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe, I should spill all my guts
Or write a letter, then tear it up
Or do a song, just to say what's up
I want ... just ... a touch

[Nelly Furtado]
I can't do this anymore
See my heart just falls out when you walk in the door
Friendship turns into lust and this only tip
That I can't comprehend even if I knew it
Can't do justice to these things that I'm feeling
You got someone else, don't wanna be caught stealing
Hell if she knew she would never leave us alone
in the roo-ooo-ooom

[Chali 2na]
This was a lesson in friendship
I stress in this sentence
Should women and men be friends first?
And then slip?
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
of devotion

[Akil]
Opposites attract
And best friends make a perfect match
If you only knew that
Once you cross, ain't no turning back
The minute you let him in it and he hit that
That's that

Jeporidizing kinship, respect is intended
Resolve is my intent

2862,390,"I’m going to be honest, I’ve never heard of this brew or even Eel River Brewery before. But as my wife and I were shopping today, the label caught our eye. So we bought it. I bought this in a bottle (obviously) and I’m drinking it my HUGE mug (which I’ve affectionately named “The Hammer of Woe”)

So, here we go!

**Appearance 3/5**
Very dark, almost black, with reddish tones. Quite foamy if you’re not careful. Large cream colored head.

**Aroma 3/5**
Very sweet. Caramel and chocolate maltiness. Not very strong aroma but I can tell this is going to be big. Very malty, no hops detected at all.

**Palate 3/5**
Velvet silkiness. Very smooth and thick but not sticky. No bite at all; I don’t know if that’s good or bad in most people’s eyes.

**Taste 2.5/5**
My first impressions went like this:
“Hmm. This is kind of boring. I’ll hold it in my mouth for a while to see what I can detect…….not a whole lot is changing.”

After I swallow….

“Wow! Excellent coffee after-taste! Very good finish!”

After a few more sips my impressions mellowed out again. It’s not very complex. Apart from the surprise ending, there isn’t much to this brew at all. It’s very malty and that’s good but it didn’t change much. It’s not very strong, there’s almost no hint of alcohol or hop flavors; it’s just…sweet.

**Overall 11.5/20**
Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t a *bad* beer. Not at all. In fact I might buy it again. It’s very drinkable, especially for an Imperial Stout. But that’s sort of the problem, I could gulp this thing down if I wanted to. When I buy an *imperial stout* I want it to make me wince a little bit. I want to have to sip it slowly and think about the way the complex flavors are changing in my mouth. This beer looks, smells, and feels excellent. But the flavor is just a little boring for an Imperial Stout. Like I said, I might buy this again but it’s not going in my list of favorites."

After a while, someone went into spectator mode and came back yelling that the guy was playing with aimbot and something about being able to see everyone through the walls. 


I took this as n00bie whining until I was hanging out on top of the boxes totally invisible looking down below at the chaos as my team was frantically trying to get the cart to the end. I had been griefing some snipers and waiting for one to stop paying attention when I see the soldier in question look up at me, stop, and fire a rocket. There's absolutely no way he could've known I was there. Nobody ran into me, I was 100 percent invisible with plenty of invisibility time left on my watch. I thought, maybe lucky shot. So once again, I go and stand in the sniper perch that looks into the red base totally invisible. The soldier kills off a few of our guys and then looks directly over at me again. Nobody is in the room with me. He fires a rocket directly at me. I then say something about how I think he might be cheating. So i team chat someone to spawn as a spy and come hide in some spots with me. We both stand there completely invisible, he looks at my teammate, fires a rocket and looks at me and fires a rocket. 


So we both call him out on it and then everyone on the team get suspicious. After some time of not responding he finally says, ""And what are you going to do about it."" So we voteban kicked him. "

2718,334,"small subdivided Group health insurance in big health insurance companies is a scam that allows insurance companies to increase rates until only the unhealthy remain in that particular ""group"" then the premiums become unaffordable for them too and the ""group"" gets closed out.

They can have as many different ""groups"" as they want and they can be tiny like say with only 200 people.

Meanwhile the insurance company sells new policies in other ""groups"" while people are healthy in a new ""group"" until people in that group also begin to get sick. Then everyone healthy from that group withdraws when someone gets sick and the premiums go up leaving only the sick person who can no longer afford the huge premiums in their ""group"" leaving them uninsured when they are sick.

And new pre or existing conditions regulation legislation will not help because the healthy people CHOOSE to withdraw from the group for a cheaper group as the one sick person's costs make their group policies more expensive so the company isn't forcing them out legally.

It's just another way insurance companies can get your money when you are healthy and then make it impossible for you to collect on your insurance when you get sick.

People always assume they are in a large group with a big insurance company so the risks are spread out a lot but insurance companies keep all their groups tiny to maximize the chance that they can discontinue coverage to the group when someone gets sick in the group.

3032,303,"Jesus said:

Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs) - John 7:22

I find this really interesting because Jesus seems to be correcting himself. To strip this of any theological meaning, it's as though Jesus  said,

""Tiberius was the emperor in 6AD  (though actually it was Augustus).""

It's not that I think this is evidence that Jesus was not perfect or anything like that. I just wonder why it was left in the text. Would the Gospel of John preserve something as mundane as the Messiah's senior moment? 

Are there any other weird anomalies like this in the NT?

Could there be a theological reason for the presence of this curious qualification in the teachings of Jesus?

Such as . . . 

""What Jesus said about circumcision - that it came from the patriarchs - is true. However, the Torah claims far more for this ancient custom. Both Genesis and Leviticus claim that circumcision came from God (Gen. 17:9-14, Lev. 12).

When Jesus attributed circumcision to the patriarchs he downgraded the importance of this ancient ritual from a command that comes from God to a custom of the patriarchs. Customs of the patriarchs may be overturned; a command from God is not so easy to ignore. Describing circumcision as an ancient custom undermines the belief that circumcision came from God. It was quite a risky thing for Jesus to say (See John 7:25).

This paved the way for Peter to attack circumcision and Paul to attack those who promote it.""

[The New Testament and Circumcision](http://www.cirp.org/pages/cultural/glass1/)

Or maybe Jesus really was just a little tired that day and he briefly misspoke, instantly correcting himself. 

But, again, why on earth would the text preserve something so insignificant?...if it was insignificant.

I thought this made some semblance of sense having LoZ come after Wind Waker. Because if all the oceans receeded then it would leave a barren sandy wasteland as seen in Legend of Zelda. Also a Link to the Past comes before Wind Waker because in the previous game Ganon is trying to make his world, which he succeeds in doing in Windwaker.  I always wondered why OoT was placed before Twilight Princess, but I guess it is because the creation of Hyrule is explained in this game and not in others. Indicating it as the genesis of Hyrule.

Would you guys be interested in a NSFW version of this subreddit?  We can call it /r/tipofmypenis.  No, seriously...I see a lot of people around reddit and the internets in general where a certain scene or something in a porn is from, and I feel like people may be embarrassed to ask here?

**Okay, now the solved TOMT:**

I heard it in the super market today.  It was an upbeat song, maybe midtempo (not really sure what midtempo is, but certainly not a slow song), kinda like the Beatles, but not them.  Almost certainly made around the year 1964.  It went something like ""...tell the world that I love you...[stuff]that I want you"".  At a couple points the music stops and he belts out ""I love you!""  The song basically revolves around the phrases ""that I want you"" and ""that I love you"".  

The singer has kinda a goofy voice.  I think he was probably American.  I also feel like it had some kind of early synthesizer or something.  

I totally forgot how the song actually goes in my head already, which sucks.  But it was popular enough to be played at the supermarket, and I think this guy may be thinking of the same song:  http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_AngloAmerican_falsetto_60s_vocal_group_sang_Say_I_love_you_doobie_dum_doobie_dum_dum_That_I_want_you_doobie_dum_doobie_dum_dum_Nonsense_words_are_lyrics_Name_the_song_too

EDIT: **Solved** 4 minutes after I submitted it, damn.  [Click to see what the answer is](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCdGqed6Ajg).  How accurate was I?

EDIT: **second question**.  Can we have spoilers tags in this subreddit?  Sometimes I still feel like looking for a song, and it's ruined when I find out that someone already solved it."

1008,242,"Has anybody experienced this?  I've had some really intense visual experiences from brief meditation on the Thoth tarot in a ceremonial magick setting.  Some of them are very matter of fact, and I understand the symbolism almost as if it's a narrated documentary, where as some are much more psychedelic feeling, and my reality changes.

Here are two examples that I have posted on my blog.  The first is the first kind, the second is the latter.

Sign of the Mountain Goat (IV: The Emperor)
I sit in on a throne of white stone in the bright glare of the noonday sun.  I look down the gentle slope of the Hill of the Sun, and see the manicured emerald lawns surrounding the white flagstone plaza.  Roads of the same white stone radiate out from the top of the hill, passing through elaborate arches in the massive stone wall.

My armies are spread out in formation before me, a show of might.  Their mail gleams in the sun, glittering silver too bright for steel.  Knights on chestnut war horses hold their shining lances upright, crimson ostrich feathers bobbing on their helms.  Groups of pikemen bristle with metal, beating a tight military rhythm on the stone.  Catapult teams ride their very weapons.  Banners and standards bear my sign: a field of pure white, bordered by pure blue, surrounds an intense red ram’s head.

Beyond the wall, strictly ordered rectangles of varying shades of green show the effects of order and will put to earth, the rich, black volcanic soil metamorphosed into clothing, food, shelter.  Behind the rolling foothills, the black mountains are dotted with herds of mountain goats.  The valleys echo with the clattering of their horns as they compete for mates.

This must be put to use on another kingdom, or it will consume me.

Calculated divine violence (Prince of Wands)
Cosmic eye issuing yellow field of radioactive light, ultraviolet sigils of genomic intent warping space, increasing gravity in expanding cheetah-patterened regiments.  Flaming charioteers roar through cosmic emptiness, snarling lions and singing blades darting away from stinking Prison walls at the last moment, calculated gravity ripples of intent battering into living wailing flesh of the Prison.  Constant assault weaken the crystalline metal structure, eventually sending flakes of virulent fungal lead into surrounding metal tissue, poisoned with its own hate….

The Prison is a steady theme in these experiences, a version of PKD's Black Iron Prison."
1956,143,"This is the third installment of a series [ontological 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/evafk/i_was_thinking_of_adding_a_section_for/), [ontological 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/evofl/second_manifestation_of_the_ontological_argument/), [Fine tuned universe](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/evv98/fine_tuned_universe/)

**The Cosmological Argument**

1. Everything that exists must have a cause.

2. The universe must have a cause (from 1).

3. Nothing can be the cause of itself.

4. The universe cannot be the cause of itself (from 3).

5. Something outside the universe must have caused the universe
(from 2 and 4).

6. God is the only thing that is outside of the universe.

7. God caused the universe (from 5 and 6).

8. God exists.

*Flaw 1*: God only adds a supernatural layer of complexity aka 'Fallacy of passing the buck'.  To put it succinctly, if God didn't need a cause then we can save a step by saying that the universe doesn't need a cause.  As tim212 points out, premise 1) contradicts the definition of God as uncaused.

*Flaw 2*: Category error in the concept of 'cause'.  Our knowledge of cause and effect is simply the reworking of already existing matter and energy.  The coming to existence of something from nothing is in fact a separate category.

*Flaw 3*: Argument from ignorance 'I don't know what happened before the big bang, therefore God.  When we didn't know how Earth might have happened, it was said that God did it.  This is the same exact argument on a larger scale.

*Flaw 4*: The assumption of 'nothing' as the default state.  We don't know if there was or was not anything before the big bang.

*Flaw 5* (thanks to Koroviev): The [Texas Sharpshooter fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_sharpshooter_fallacy) is committed in the definition of 'God'.  God is defined in a way that would make it feasible in this argument only because it would be feasible rather than on its own merits.

Edit: Let me clarify that I don't think that being religious or Atheist is simply a matter of Genes. Also, I'm not talking about people who would rather adopt. To me, that's the same as bearing your own children. 

I am just interested in why it seems most (or at least a majority of) scientific and/or Atheistic people I meet feel it's a better use of their time to forgo children and instead focus on educating the children of others, for instance. It seems a bit arrogant when you think of it like that; ""Let the idiots breed, I'll fix their mistakes!"". Why not, at least on top of that, bring a child into the world (or adopt) and take an active interest in raising that child how you think a person should be raised. Educate it to the greatest degree. Teach it right from wrong, independent of what some religion teaches. Then send it out in the world to increase the knowledge of others. 

To claim that you don't want children because it would detract from your mission on earth is to claim that you believe the problems of Earth could be fixed within your lifetime. How arrogant can one get?"
10288,234,"I was raised a christian scientist and was exposed to the methodist church, (sunday school program) my parents did not attend the methodist church. I became an agnostic in my teens. During the breakup of my marriage I was *saved* by my wifes baptist minister brother, I was 34 then. I did experience an actual physical sensation that lasted about 2 weeks. Later, I lived with a jehovahs witness that coerced me to attend for nearly a year, we split up. I maintained a realtionship with god, including a slightly alcohol fueled week long quest that involved prayer, living in the woods and traveling the highways rescuing stranded people and motorists. At the end of this sojourn I had what can be described as a mystical experience. That was about 8 years ago. My faith was reinforced by that experience and I seemed to be growing closer to god. However the last 4 years have seen the loss of many close friends and family to premature death. The final straw for me was the passing of my dearest and oldest friends wife 2 years ago, we were quite close and were an outlet for each others experiences. When my friend called me and told me she died my belief shut off like a switch. It was just gone. I went over a year before confiding in my son that I was now an Atheist. 

Finally, I have had metaphysical experiences that I eventually attributed to god. Things like precognition in dreams and psychic events. Where do I file these real experiences I have had?

edit per request:

time: 2 weeks after my 16th birthday

reference: I have always been a vivid technicolor dreamer, often with recurring dreams.

the dream: 

+ I was alone in the family car

+ I was not belted did not wear them then

+ I crashed, rolling the car along a narrow ditch

+ I was unhurt

+ the car stopped forming a *bridge* spanning the 5' deep ditch pointing to the road

+ When I exited the car, looking down there was a brightly colored child's blanket lying in the ditch bottom.

+ I woke up sweating and immediately recounted the dream to my parents.



The reality: 1 month later.

+ I was alone in the family car

+ I was not belted did not wear them then

+ I crashed, rolling the car along a narrow ditch

+ I was unhurt

+ the car stopped forming a *bridge* spanning the 5' deep ditch pointing to the road

+ When I exited the car, looking down there was a raggedy ann doll lying in the ditch bottom.

+ I had slight scratches on my scalp where I may have broken the drivers window with my head but never lost consciousness

+ The crash suspended time, I felt an all encompassing sense of compassion and love.

+ I saw the 'Book of my Life' unfolded before me (very vividly) but quickly and all encompassing along with that warm fuzzy feeling.

+ I was sure I would awaken safe in my bed.

+ It was a different car

+ My parents were stunned, surprised I was unhurt, the car's roof was crushed except where I sat.

10429,249,"I'm by no means new to gaming- I've been a console guy since the 64.  But I'm finally replacing my crap laptop with an awesome gaming PC, and I'm wondering what games I should get?

I already have Starcraft II.  And Fallout NV and 3 for Xbox.  And Bioshock.  Basically, what I'm asking for is PC exclusives (or PS3/PC exclusives, so I won't have it for Xbox) that are great.  I plan on getting Crysis (should I get Warhead or the original? not both), GTA IV (don't have it for 360 so why not), and that's it.

I've already played all the Half Lifes.  I've got The Orange Box for Xbox (but I would love TF2 for PC).

tl;dr: any good PC exclusives or under-the-radar indie games that would do my new PC justice?  I specifically like RPG's like Fallout.  Free-worlds blow my mind.

EDIT:

You guys are so awesome!  Thanks!"
5441,160,"Hello! I am a very experienced, energetic, hyperactive, creative, and fun-loving miner looking for a server to call home. However, most servers aren't at all good. Here is what I am looking for

* A community! Not just building random towers, We should be close knit and know each other

* Survival! its SMP people, not CMP. Go to creative if you like building houses out of diamond.

* A vanilla experience! not asking for no mods, but I want to play, not have everything done for me with teleports and !give all and kits and the like.

* A website! Sure talking in game is great, but without a hub where there are announcements, polls, maps, discussion, and planning, servers tend to fall apart.

* A white/grey list! This serves multiple purposes. First, it drives away over 90% of griefers! Second, If people take the time to apply, we will know more about them. And third, if somebody takes the time to apply and wait for approval, they are much more likely to stay for a long while!

If anybody knows any servers like this, please post here!

2498,365,"....Not out of guilt, but out of worry. If your company is successful and big enough, it becomes a target for hackers. The ""big"" part means at least a few employees who use ""coffee12"" for their password for your network and Facebook, or an IT person installing something insecure. I know there are plenty of policies you can implement to mitigate issues, but when something does come up, you pretty much have to answer to people who have little clue about the challenges you face and are likely to blame/ax you unfairly.

So, given that, how paranoid are you of a breach...even when you're not on the clock? And, if you've ever had a security issue, how easy was it to get the higher-ups to understand that (...assuming you weren't solely to blame) if-only-you-followed-these-seemingly-anal-retentive-policies things would be OK?

Every technological profession has this kind of issue...Rocket engineers for example. But if a rocket-ship blows up, I feel that it's harder to jump on the engineering department (without easy proof, at least) because to 99% of the population, rocket science is beyond their comprehension and they've never been on a rocketship or examined any of its components.

But everyone has been on Facebook/Twitter/GMail and might feel they have a good idea of how easy it is to keep, say, their own accounts secure...kind of the same way that everyone experiences weather, and can remember times when they thought it was going to rain and it did...so why do those idiot meteorologists seem to get it wrong all the time?

Net-sec sounds like a good field, and one in demand...it just seems like it could be disproportionately nerve-wracking.


** edit: I work in web development and don't do net-sec, beyond helping non-techie coworkers with their computers. I took a few grad level net-sec classes, but mostly in cryptography...theory seems fun...actual corporate security sounds harrowing..."

I found a really nice excel spreadsheet that had all the programs and all that, but really how important is it to track what I'm doing? I know it would be good to see my improvement of the next 89 days, but I felt like after every work out I had to pause type in how many reps I did then get back into it and when I decided to wait till the end I couldn't remember what I had done. I did do all the measurements and photos so I can have that record to match up against on the final day. 

Also guys what kind of clothes do you work out in? I was in a pair of basketball shorts and no shirt because it was to soaked after the first half hour (who am I kidding I was sweating at the end of the warm ups).

4542,41,"(Skip to question if you don't want to read backstory)

A while back I returned an Alesis Micron to Guitar Center (faulty power supply, Alesis wouldn't respond) and recieved my $300 credit back for the purchase.

I've since saved up $400 more to go towards a better and more advanced synth.  However, the one I had my eye on (Roland SH-201) just got removed from GC's online store last night.  I'm going to call them tomorrow to see if I can order it by phone, but I decided to ask your advice anyway.

-

Here's the real question:

What can I do with $300 of GC credit and $400 cash that would maximize the fun I can have with a new instrument?  

The option I'm leaning towards right now is to get a good midi controller from GC and a rack mounted synth from eBay.  Any tips if I go down this road?


Also, I don't actually know how to play piano that well, but I do know that I want to learn very badly.  The few times my Micron worked, I played it for hours on end.

Any clue how I could put my money to the best use with a goal of enjoying myself?"

4055,256,"I know pitchers and catcher don't report for another two months but I can't help but think ahead to how baseball betting would work, being the hardcore fan that I am.

With a 162 game schedule picking any one game would be too difficult.  Even basing it off pitching match-ups and recent offensive success is not a guarantee in baseball.

So my theory is that you figure out who will win the series, and then bet on all 3 or 4 games of that series.  While it's harder to figure out who will win a particular game, it's a little bit easier to figure out who will win a 3 game series.  Let's also assume that you start with a **bankroll of $330**.

Example:

Let's take a Angels-Rangers series.  Let's assume that assume that the Rangers are favorites.

Game 1:

* Rangers -3 (-110)  Bet $110 to win $100 **Win BR=$430**

* Rangers -1 (-110)  Bet $110 to win $100 **Lose BR=$320**

* Rangers -2 (-110)  Bet $110 to win $100 **Win BR=$420**

You come out winning $90.

You could also withhold betting in certain games based on pitching matchup or other reason.

You could of course bet on single games as you see fit, but it seems it would be wise to treat single games like parlays, don't expect to get them right a lot.

This could turn out to be horrible idea as I have only been betting for a few days and have no idea how baseball betting lines look.

Thoughts?

5292,402,"These theorems are often misunderstood. Here is a distillation:

It follows from the Peano Axioms* that one can construct a sentence that says the following:

""There does not exist an ordered list of a finite number of sentences such that each sentence is an axiom or follows logically (eg by Modus Pones) from previous sentences *and this sentence is the final sentence*""

In English this means ""This sentence has no proof"".

What if this sentence is false? Then we can prove something that is false, and all of mathematics is inconsistent. This is no good.

What if this sentence is true? Then **there are truths that cannot be proven** in the strictest mathematical sense.

*Actually, Gödel used a set of axioms that is weaker than the Peano Axioms - it didn't even include the axiom of mathematical induction.

Here is the lowdown on the interesting part of the proof:

How does he achieve the self-reference? His technique is called ""Gödel numbering"". You can assign a unique number to ALL of the possible sentences that follow from those axioms (more precisely, there is a 1-1 correspondence between the natural numbers and those sentences). To do this, you start with the axioms and give them a number, then you build up from these axioms with conjunction, disjunction, etc, and along the way number the new formulas you create in such a way that you are uniquely numbering all the possible formulas (easier said than done!)

order by alertSubject asc

The query returns (as a sample)

(Really sorry for the image share, was the easiest way i could bother to think about)

What i need to do, is select distinct based on NOTE, but, the values never distinct because of a time stamp. 

What happens is, we get 50 alarms saying a computers are offline. Most of the time, the cause is the same, i need to generate a report based 1 Server id, that contains multiples of the same error

AS you can see in the screen shot. NOTE is where the acknowledgment of the error sits. If i didn't have the time stamp, it would be a simple distinct, but i have to put up with it.

Does anyone see a way of diplaying ONESERVERNAME, ERRORNAME, HOWMANYTIMESITHAPPENED? Based on note

I have confused myself i hope this makes sense to you kind peoples."

9061,136,"The Corn Refiners Association (CRA) constantly tries to persuade the public that high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is perfectly safe, claiming that it is natural, made from corn, similar to sugar, and acceptable in moderation. The truth is – there are a lot of reasons to avoid high-fructose corn syrup.


A processed alternative to sugar, HFCS is a favorite of the food industry for its ability to provide maximum sweetness at minimal cost. While HFCS might be inexpensive to manufacture, its widespread use over the last 25 years has come at a high price to consumers.


Some studies suggest that HFCS itself is not necessarily worse than sugar, but the amount Americans consume contribute to health risks. Since fructose is processed by the liver, large amounts in the diet can cause an increased triglyceride synthesis, causing fat storage in the liver and increasing cardiovascular risk, fatty liver disease, hypertension, and metabolic dysfunction. In addition, since a high presence of fructose can block the body's ability to use insulin to regulate sugar, over-consumption of HFCS can cause insulin resistance, leading to metabolic disorders, obesity and type 2 diabetes.


HFCS is present in a seemingly endless number of processed foods – from yogurt to salad dressing—and moderate intake of this particular ingredient proves to be a major challenge. In fact, the average total consumption of HFCS is approximately 13 teaspoons per day with the likelihood of even higher levels among certain populations, including children and teens.


A recent study revealed that nine out of twenty samples of commercial HFCS contained detectable levels of the heavy metal, mercury—presumably, the result of contamination with “mercury-grade” caustic soda during the HFCS manufacturing process. In the United States, current regulation is limited only to methyl mercury in fish, but if these results are any indication, new practices are undoubtedly in order. In the meantime, keeping products containing HFCS as far away from your plate as possible appears to be the only truly safe precaution.


Heavy metal toxicity is a major health problem with frightening consequences for both children and adults. It is a modern crisis that should not be ignored and this study sheds light on just one more potential (and very prevalent) source of exposure to toxins.


It is essential to become educated about the dangers of heavy metal toxicity, as well as ways to protect yourself and your loved ones from contamination. One way to stay protected is by learning more about heavy metal toxicity by visiting www.dreliaz.org/recommends-condition-toxicity and sharing these useful prevention tips with your friends and family members.

7887,49,"A while back, I posted a request to find a cheaper MFLB [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/exw0l/anywhere_i_can_get_a_cheap_mflb/). $100 was out of my price-range, and I knew the reddit community could help me figure something out. My request got a few replies, some offering sound advice, and one in particular stuck out. A fellow redditor, fellow **ent**, scarysockpuppet, replied to my post asking for my info to send me an [MFLB](http://www.amazon.com/Magic-Flight-Launch-Box/dp/B0029NRM2U) for free! I was shocked, and like any other, I was obviously skeptical. I knew reddit was awesome, and that fellow ents helped out other ents on a daily basis, but such a thoughtful thing to do from someone is almost unheard-of. I threw caution to the wind, and after a few hours of browsing, I was sent a message with an Amazon tracking number for my gift. Everyone I know was skeptical, but I had such faith in the community that I knew scarysockpuppet wouldn't let me down.

Days passed. I grew more and more anxious. My car was broken into the week before, so this seemed like a little karma coming my way and something I eagerly awaited. I shared my story with anyone that was listening, spreading the ent love and letting others know that somewhere in this world, there is some good shit happening. I waited with patience. The day never arrived.

On Jan. 19th, I was home from work, and checked my mail early to see if it had came. The 19th was the last day of the estimated arrival time. After a few hours, the mail comes, and still no MFLB. I sighed a long sigh, feeling the weight of the United States Postal Service letting me down.

I contacted scarysockpuppet and explained. He gave me the USPS tracking number, and I discovered that the package was delivered on the 15th!! I was at work from 10-6, and the package was marked ""delivered"" at 3:30pm. I talked to the post office, and after talking with the courier who delivered it, was told that the package was left on my door step. My wife and mother were home, and have both confirmed that no mailman came to the door. A package with a hundred dollars of merchandise, eagerly anticipated, was left on my porch. 

Now, I can honestly say that I live around elderly people and that my neighborhood has always felt extremely safe. I cannot imagine who would want to steal a package off of a doorstep in broad daylight, *much less* in my neighborhood. 

Scarysockpuppet has put in a claim with Amazon, and I've tried everything I can think of with the post office. The post office supervisor told me that since my neighborhood had a low rate of crime, the couriers just drop packages off in front of a house without a signature. For real.

I had to get this out. After my hopes in humanity are raised with redditor scarysockpuppet, they are agonizingly taken away with the United States Postal Service. With a package being confirmed ""delivered"", they will no longer take responsibility. Our last hope at redemption lies in Amazon. So far, they have been more than helpful, but I am expecting that nothing will come of that either. I look like a scammer trying to get the same product twice, or money back for something I have. My story is all I have. 

Any advice would be wonderful. I have contacted the USPS, Amazon, and the USPS Investigators to resolve this. I have a strong feeling that this wasn't random doorstep-mail theft. 

TLDR; Redditor gifted something awesome, it gets lost or stolen in the mail, up to Amazon to save the day

8768,656,"So I've been writing back and forth to a girl on PoF.com lately. We've been talking for a couple of weeks, and I thought we were hitting it off. In the last message I sent her, last night, I included my Facebook link, since I didn't want to scare her off by asking for her number (I never did understand that about chicks online. You can be hitting it off and have tons of shit in common, but ask for her number and you'll never hear from her again...)

So in record time (she usually takes about 2-3 days to respond) I get this gem:

&gt;I'm sorry I can't do this right now. I feel like I owe you an explanation because you seem like a nice guy. I orriginally wrote one out but it's really much more than you need to know. Long story short, one of my best friends just hurt me in a way I never expected from him and it reminded me all the reasons I'd rather be lonely than broken.

&gt;Best of luck to you!

My first instinct is that this is bullshit; that she dug around on my Facebook page, saw something that she didn't like, and came up with a bullshit excuse.

However, I'm not always very good about reading people, especially when I haven't yet met them in person. If her friend really did hurt her, then I'd like to try and be supportive. But if she's just being a bitch without the integrity to be honest about what's bothering her, then I don't want anything to do with her.

But I started to get tired of Worf whenever he started preaching about being a warrior or moaning about his honor. I remember as a kid I would facepalm whenever Worf started to sing.

He sides with the Federation during the brief war with the klingons and is the man destroying ship after ship of Warriors of the Empire, knowing full well that after all those years without honor and finally getting it back (another selfless act to protect his homeland) he will be an outcast again.


Picard is also totally devoted to duty in a way the other captains are not, Kirk even comments on this. Kirk is totally devoted to his ship, Janeway is totally devoted to the individuals in her crew (I think owing to her feeling responsible for getting them stuck in the first place) Sisko is more grounded because he is ultimately more concerned with being a father over being an officer but Picard is all about duty. Get the job done, your personal feelings are irrelevant. It's why he turns the girl down in ""Perfect Mate"". It's why he doesn't pursue a relationship with that science officer who plays the piano because he knows if he had to choose between the mission her, she loses.

there are more examples of each but it's been a long post and I feel like an ubernerd but I'm happy that there is a community of people out there who share the same passion that I have.

3570,128,"I am trying to figure out the best, or most efficient way of doing this.

My website is written in PHP on the server side, with a MySQL DB and using javascript and jQuery on the client side. 

The user comes to this one specific page (i.e. map.php) which contains an image map.  There are five different clickable areas on this map.  Each area has a queue of images that will go down the queue, loading each image sequentially as the user clicks on the image.  For example, if you click on area A then it might generate the queue A1.jpg, A2.jpg, A3.jpg, A4.jpg, map.jpg.  First it will load image A1.jpg, when the user clicks on the image, it then loads A2.jpg etc.  The last image returns them back to the main map.  

When they click on one of the five areas on the main map, javascript removes all the clickable areas and creates a new area which is the whole image for the user to click on.  Returning back to map.jpg also re-adds the five image map areas.

To make things a bit more complicated.  None of the 5 areas have the same queue and you might not keep coming back to the same image queue.

For example, the first time you click on area A you might go through A1, A2, A3, A4 and map.  The second time they return to A the queue might be A3, A4, map.  A trigger by viewing an external page (outside of map.php) might turn the next queue into A5, A3, A4, or A6, A3, A4 or A7, A3, A4.  A final image queue could be A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, ... A18.

And image map area B, C, D and E can all have different image queues.

Now I am trying to think of how to do this but no matter how I try and write it, it seems overly complicated and there must be a better way.  I thought of possibly storing each possible image queue in the DB and then store what ""state"" each user is at on map.php.  But the database state might need to change and since the front-end is in javascript I wasn't sure how to do this.  There's also the issue of pre-loading the images to try and get them as smooth as possible.

That's why I am here to try and ask for ideas and opions, try and bounce ideas around to help me think of a better way to do this.  "

Each post could be it's own sort of Rorschach and then I'd encourage you to comment with whatever comes to mind. The comments are also a great place for outside links.

The best part about the this community is that it can really go anywhere and be as eclectic as possible. 

I know my posts have all been sort of similar but I'd really like to see what sort of unusual things people could do within the parameters of this concept. Let's try to think outside the box. Or the Hexagon as it may be.

I'd also be willing to make someone a Moderator in exchange for frequent posting and recruitment if anyone's interested.

And finally let's talk about the look of this subreddit. Does anyone have any ideas? I'm not great with CSS but there's enough helpful places to look I think I could figure it out or find someone to do it for me. Is it too early to start thinking about a logo?

8372,31,"Discarding the medium (Jeremy Kyle), if what was shown on this program is true, why does it take him to get people off their arse?

One of the 'couples' he looked at were Cheryl and Robin, she has 6 children by different fathers (from the age of 16) and is now 27 expecting child #7. 

All their rent, bills, utilities are paid for (aside from car insurance which seemed to aggreive her), and she pockets £1700 per calendar month in other benefits which Kyle describes as 'spending money' as 99% of her bills are paid - what is the reason for her partner to go to work?

EDIT - Robin  was wearing £40 Superdry jumper and new Nikes, he is out of work.

Another guy was told he had a start at a job paying minimum wage, if he worked 6 hours a week and earned £50 then they (benefits agency) would take the £50 from his benefits leaving him 'only' £15 in jobseekers allowance.

The point I hope to make is that all through these stories Kyle talked about self respect and the respect of your neighbours or others within the community.

The truth is, in a lot of families there is no sense of self respect, no reason to earn the respect of your peers, especially if all your neighbours are also benefit reliant people who share tips about how to get the most out of the system.

He talked also about how the people he interviewed realised that they were taking advantage - he called the girl with 6 children (and one on the way) a 'baby maker' - who knew the system would be there for her if she wanted to devote her life to raising children.

What has happened to this country? 30 years ago if you ready to have children you would have to work out how you could pay for them - you were lucky to have more than one or two you could support yourself with the limited help you got from the government.

I realise kyle is a stage managed job but believe me, in the small village where I live there are carbon copies of these 'families', and it makes me wonder what will become of this girls 7 children, will they end up the same as their parents?

Is there any point working in England for near to minimum wage? I don't think there is thanks to the benefits available. Have kids - acquire money.

I think for the first time I have seen myself as a primate, and in turn, seen others.  I was carrying some food upstairs, and due to the objects I was holding, had to walk differently to keep everything balanced.  I found myself walking in that odd side to side gait that chimpanzees use when upright.

I've known and agreed with our ancestry but for some reason that act solidified it, I *felt* like a primate, an animal.  I know that I am one but as I moved each leg and felt the anticipation of satiating my hunger I was a beast.  We're slightly more advanced than our genetic neighbors, yet we see our intelligence as leaps and bounds above the rest of DNA's progeny.  Our slight advantage has reaped exponential rewards, this combined with our conscious perspective, has baited us into a solipsistic view.  

I often marvel at the progress our species has made.  The Wright Brothers flew in 1905 and just 64 years later man walked on the moon.  Let's assume that each of my ancestors lived to be 60 (quite generous), I am only 5 generations removed from Isaac Newton.  A mere 33 generations away from Caesar, and just 75 from the completion of Khufu's Great Pyramid.  In evolutionary terms these steps are very, very tiny.

We are not far from a time when our species held the same abilities or communication levels of living chimpanzees.  Highly non-verbal (and we still primarily are) and struggling with basic stone tools or devices.  Written language is a new invention for humans.  Everything is new.  A visitor who came to our planet 20,000 years ago would barely be able to tell us apart from the other primates in terms of intelligence (i'm making a broad statement here, obviously we had a greater capacity or potential at that point).  And going back 20,000 years would only extend to around 330 generations given a 60 year span.  If you stood in a line with all of these people you could see the end of the line.

Without doubt a day will come when our future progeny wonder what sort of mental capacity the humans of today had.  We will be their brute cavemen living in wooden rectangles, farming for food, and staring at pictures all day.

If we are ever to understand our selves in any appreciable manner we must learn to step outside of our perspective, to lose any idea that we are special, whether as an individual or species.  We are the output of a complex code.  We are the most effective environmental manipulator that DNA has produced.  Perhaps we could look at ourselves as a threshold on a gradient.  The moment where the shade looks more white than black, yet still only a step away from the convoluted gray.  

We must confront the distractions of superiority head on, lest the trivial become the wading pool of the curious cognates.  Doubt is essential, and we must doubt ourselves before it can become a strength.  On that day I doubted the idea of my being, and despite the questions it produces, I found a clearer view of myself and how our species interacts.  Not to get into a religious discussion, but the day I saw the Bible as a history of belief, written by men searching for answers, is the day religion made sense.  Applying that simple idea to so many contradictions or questions I encountered resulted in new ideas and perspectives.  In the same vein, so long as we keep these superficial ideas and concepts about the state of our being we'll forever wallow in self love and cultural reinforcement.  Whatever you are you must see it before you can be it.

I'll end this ridiculous rant with another favorite quote of mine which I feel applies well.

""Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never traveled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect.""

I walked slowly back into the bedroom to let my eyes adjust, and climbed back under the covers to find that my girlfriend was facing away from me, toward the wall.  I reached out and touched her.  She was cold, too cold even for sleeping on a freezing winter night.  I touched her somewhere else.  Cold.  I studied her for a second, and it dawned on me like stress fractures through glass: That is not my girlfriend.  That is not even breathing.  I flung the covers back in a rare moment of courage.  It began to shake.  Not violently, but more like it was tensing every muscle in its body.  I was mortified.  I was frozen.  I began to hear it mumbling.

""Baby...b..b...baby""

Its hand shot down to its bare thigh and began to make long, slow scratches with its fingernails.  I could do nothing but watch as the scratching grew faster and faster, harder and harder.  Soon the skin was curling off like string cheese, and thick, black blood was oozing down its leg and splattering all over the bed.  It kept accelerating, until the scratching was at an absolutely feverish pace.  

""Baby...baby...""

My open mouth turned to a grimace of terror as the scratching sound abruptly changed, and I realized that it had hit bone.  The sound now was horrible; I can only compare it to nails on a chalkboard at a deafening volume.  Its fingernails began to crack and pop off.  1.  2.  3.  At that point I closed my eyes and started grinding my teeth, anything to get that sound out of my head.

""BABY!""

I jolted awake, my girlfriend's face looming over me.  

""What?"" I managed.

""You were having a bad dream."" 

""Oh"" I said.

She gave a weak smile, and promptly laid back down, facing away from me.

&gt;Relationship Status? 


&gt;&gt;Single



##Favorites: 


&gt;Cats or Dogs? 


&gt;&gt;Cats, absolutely. I feel like dogs require too much of my attention and I feel bad if I'm not constantly giving it to them.


&gt;Favorite beverage? 


&gt;&gt;Earl Grey, hot.



&gt;Food? 


&gt;&gt;Anchovy Pizza! I could eat it every single day.


&gt;Movie/tv show? 


&gt;&gt;Obviously Futurama. I also enjoy/enjoyed Big Bang Theory, Community, Big Love, Adventure Time with Finn and Jake, Star Trek TNG/DS9, Battlestar Galactica, Deadwood and Gilmore Girls (Yes, it's a good show.)


&gt;&gt;As for movies, my favorite would probably be The Land Before Time or Jurassic Park. I love dinosaurs.



&gt;Music? 


&gt;&gt;I've been really into Fleet Foxes, Band of Horses and Noah and the Whale lately. (I just now realized they all have animals in their name.)


&gt;Book? 


&gt;&gt;I could try to sound super intelligent and well-read here, but honestly? My favorite is probably The Dark Tower series by Stephen King. I also enjoyed the Harry Potter series, His Dark Materials, Lord of the Rings, Nineteen Eighty-Four and Stranger in a Strange Land to name a few.


&gt;Game? 


&gt;&gt;I was super into Left 4 Dead on PC for a long time as well as Killing Floor. A few other favorites are Fallout 3, Portal, Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Pokemon Snap. I also still play Runescape (believe me, I'm not proud.)


##Miscellanea: 


&gt;What makes you laugh? 


&gt;&gt;I'll go there: Farts make me laugh a lot.


&gt;What is your biggest pet peeve? 


&gt;&gt;Is it weird that I really can't think of anything?



&gt;What general area of your country you live in? 


&gt;&gt;Maryland


&gt;Do you love it? 


&gt;&gt;Ehh. Not really the area I live in. It's pretty, but there's absolutely nothing to do.



&gt;What was the best thing about the last year? 


&gt;&gt;That it's over. :) Last year was a pretty bad one for me.



&gt;What are you looking forward to in the year ahead? 


&gt;&gt;The second part of The Deathly Hallows!


&gt;If You Were Granted One Do-over, What Would It Be? 


&gt;&gt;Absolutely nothing. I've fucked up a lot of things in my life, but I would be way too paranoid that even a small change in my past could fuck up the future even more.



&gt;A butterfly flaps its wings... what small thing have you done or said that lead to something disproportionately larger? 


&gt;&gt;Nothing yet, but we shall see. :)



&gt;All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you? 


&gt;&gt;Perseverance. Absolutely. If I didn't keep trying, I wouldn't be here right now.



##Concerning reddit: 


&gt;What is the origin or meaning of your user name? 


&gt;&gt;From Futurama: Leela: ""You know Zapp, someone ought to teach you a lesson."" Zapp: ""If it's a lesson in love, watch out! I suffer from a very sexy learning disability. What do I call it, Kif?"" Kif: sigh ""Sexlexia.""



&gt;Total number of reddit identities you’ve had? 


&gt;&gt;Four. Only one wasn't a Futurama reference and this is one of my newer ones, even though it's a year old.



&gt;What is your favorite part of reddit? 


&gt;&gt;The humor in the comments. It's like everyone has the same sense of humor as I do and I love it. My favorite subreddits are probably /r/trees and lately /r/inglip. I also enjoy /r/TwoXChromosomes for my girly fix.



&gt;What do you do when you’re not on reddit? 


&gt;&gt;I play video games a lot. When I actually decide to venture into the outside world, my best friend and I usually go through our Weird Maryland, Weird New Jersey and Weird Pennsylvania books to find something haunted or creepy to visit.



&gt;Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so? 


&gt;&gt;Of course.


&gt;If so, do you think it’s been for the better? 


&gt;&gt;I can't say whether it's for the better or worse, but everything changes over time and we either adapt or leave. I'm still here.



##Final Question: 


&gt;Is there anything you'd like to plug/promote/advocate? 


&gt;&gt;The legalization of medical (or otherwise) marijuana. Marijuana helps so many people all over the world every single day and it's so sad that the majority of us have to either go without something that makes our lives a billion times better or hide the fact we use it, buy it illegally and risk jail time just to feel better."

5503,495,"Chinese girl, not a girl I'm attracted to but I want to ""seduce""(1) her mentally. 

Met her before and swiped her lunch for convenience but made sure she knows she owes me a dinner. We go to a small place and grab some food. We talk about philosophy, music, piano, high school experience, ice skating, etc. 
Then we moved onto a frozen yogurt place, where we continued our conversation on an even greater array of topics. I did a lot of teasing which worked really well.  Since she paid for the dinner, I paid for her yogurt. But thankfully for me she asked, so this means I owe you again? To which I smiled and said, ""of course!""

The only problem was that after the yogurt, I wanted to part but I couldn't bring myself to bring it clear. And she started walking with me to my residence, which is towards the opposite direction for her to take to get to her home. I brought this up, and she said, it's ok I'll walk this way. So after a few steps I said, let's turn, we'll walk the other way. Basically instead of parting to show time constraint/make myself scarce I ended up ""providing"" for her a little by walking her maybe halfway to her home. She pointed out I should head back before I did, which I didn't like; I wanted to be the one to bring up that I'm heading back.

Some questions:

1. I found an advice here useful that advocated going to multiple places to distort sense of time and making the encounter more exciting. I remembered to change the location, but I only had one idea: frozen yogurt or ice cream. What are some things I could do in pretty urban(?) setting (Westwood)? There are convenience stores, and I remembered Wygant's shop with a limited budget activity but I didn't think that was the best idea to pull off spontaneously with a person who might not be totally comfortable with me. There are bars, but she's not the type to really drink (doesn't even drink coffee). There are dessert place (diddy reese) which wouldn't have been a bad idea but we got yogurt already. Starbuck's and Boba places exist, but I think they are in the same after-dinner category as yogurt. So what are some activities in an urban setting that I can arrange to put some spice on a normal dinner? It doesn't have to be to this specific picky girl (who doesn't drink alcohol, boba, or coffee); I'd like general ideas.

2. I found that we ended up having conversations on a broad range of topics. But it was just that: a very long, albeit interesting, conversation on multiple different topics. With teasing, it was definitely engaging, but I want something to really excite her. What would be a good transition from conversations to really make an experience memorable (nonsexual physical activities/actions included)? When would be a good time? We were both excited talking to each other, but I want to really enrich the experience with more than talk (but not sexual closes)

3. What are some topics to avoid? And some that solidify a person's view of a seducer as a ""seducer?"" The topics mentioned include preference of skin colors, girls entering 30s without getting married, asian boy/girl groups. But I feel like some of the more ""feminine"" or  less ""masculine"" topics change the status of a seducer more into a friend.

4. What do you feel about showing some cockiness? For example, 
	
	I've only had frozen yogurt once 4 years ago.
	 
	so you only eat frozen yogurt with handsome guys huh? *smile* just kidding haha."" 

5. What do you about my having paid for her frozen yogurt here? Shouldn't have done?


(1) By ""seduce"" I mean to make her attracted to me.

10309,150,"Those holding political power in Egypt have chosen to answer the people's calls for democracy with lethal violence. International organisations must take it upon themselves to heed these calls at this turning point in history. Democratic governments cannot idly stand by. We call upon you to take action and show the world that you are on the side of the people and their fight for freedom and democracy.

Your support of the popular uprisings in Arabic countries has been ambiguous, if not absent altogether. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton exemplified the indecisiveness of the international community as she claimed that the US ""could not take sides"". Neutrality amounts to complicity as totalitarian regimes are showing their contempt for the citizens' right to protest. Mubarak's regime attempted to disconnect the Egyptian people from the rest of the world by cutting off internet communication, while his foot soldiers shot civilians and assaulted domestic and international journalists.

It is up to you to work for the people and support the universal right to freedom of speech. It is your prerogative to oppose violent regimes, regardless of your political affiliation. The geopolitical concerns for 'stability' have for far too long served as an excuse to ignore the violations of human rights.

People throughout the Arab world have been victimized and held hostage by their regimes. Now the people are standing up. The current situation within Egypt presents the leadership of the world with a unique opportunity to acknowledge and respect the people's ambition to control its own future. This is also the time when the question will finally be answered, once and for all: are Western governments truly ""of, by, and for the people"" or are they merely puppet facades, designed to ensure the continued domination by those in power?

Anonymous has made its choice. We will take sides. We will support people who strive for freedom of speech, assembly and communication - the civil rights essential for the people to forge their own futures.

10260,563,"Ok so I know moving is not that uncommon; some people do it several times in their lives. But, surely it's still hard every time. I've been in my city my whole life and I have my own friends and school and all these memories I don't want to leave behind. What's worse, I'm moving all the way to the west coast (I live more toward the east now) so it's not like I'm every really going to be able to visit or anything. I'll basically be leaving everything behind for good. I know you could just say, ""Wow, you're moving to California and you have money (my family has a lot of it; I'm treated like freakin' royalty a lot of the time), that's so terrible."" I understand I should count my blessings, but anyone that has gone through this understands. The hardest part, I think, will be leaving my best friend Jeffrey. He and I go way way back. Everyone has or should have a childhood friend like he was. If you're lucky, like me, you'll be tight until your are physically torn apart like we are being now. I feel like he has been my only true friend in life between everyone being a fake friend (family's money, remember) and those who resented the affluence. He just never cared what I had, he was just Jeffrey and we were friends until the end... I'm just sad the end has to come now. I have amazing memories of playing sports and basketball after school waiting for our parents to pick us up. He always stuck by me when I'd get bullied by the jealous kids. I got in one little fight, and my mom got scared; she said you're moving in with your auntie and uncle in bel air. I whistled for a cab, and when it came near, the license play said, ""fresh,"" and it had dice in the mirror. If anything, I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, ""Nah, forget it, yo homes, to bel air!"" I pulled up to a house about seven or eight and I said to the cabbie, ""Yo homes, smell you later."" I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there to sit on my throne as the prince of bel air. Clearly, this is a messed up situation, and I know many a redditor has gone through with it before. I know you can move past it and make new friends, I'm just not sure how. I'm here now, what do I do?

To loosely describe a debate for these purposes, I'll basically state my opinion and position on a subject or idea, I may also expound a little and explain my reasons for having said stance on the subject. You, will then have a counter argument or rebuttal if you do not agree. To quote the rules of reddiquette,  ""Don't downvote opinions just because you disagree with them. The down arrow is for comments that add nothing to the discussion.""




&lt;subject to be debated&gt;
Parents should be held accountable to a certain degree for the actions of their dependents. 

I feel this way because parents are the ones who train their children on morality and what's right and wrong. Children are the culmination of all their life experiences. I agree that there comes a certain point when a child gains a full sense of morality and is then able make their own decision to do something that may be wrong. But a majority of the life experiences that dictate the child's decision come from their upbringing.

In other cases, negligent parents have way more kids than they should be having. These neglected children are much more likely to be a burden upon society and contribute to the crime rates. I feel that if parents were held more accountable for the actions of their offspring we may see a decline in crime and other acts that degrade society.

I'm located on the corner of Kelton &amp; Gayley, right next to UCLA campus.

We have a big, three-bedroom apartment. One of the bedrooms is opening up; two girls (students) were sharing it up until last month. The landlord wants $650/each for two; if you want the room to yourself it would probably be something like $900-1000.

The room isn't large, but it opens directly to the living room, which is very spacious. There's also a small reading room (windows all along one wall) which would be open for your use.

The living situation is perfect for college students, but could also be acceptable for a professional starting out.

I really like the apartment and think it's worth the extra pricetag. The landlord used to actually LIVE here, so it's decked out really nicely: dishwasher, washer and dryer.

You'd be sharing the bathroom with my roommate, a postdoc. He's courteous and clean. The bathroom itself is very nice, with a huge shower with two showerheads.

**If you're interested in the room or know someone else who's looking, PM me and we can talk more.**

1609,174,"So Reddit, I'm really looking for help here from current JD students, younger lawyers, or people who are advisors/on law school admissions boards (though, that last one may seem like a bit harder to find). Basically people who have had more recent experiences with the process.  

Basically I have some questions about applying to schools. First,  let me tell you I graduated college (big and pretty decently ranked state school: Rutgers) last May. I took the LSAT last year and got a 161. I was hoping to do better, but there was a new type of logic game on there that I really feel hurt my score. I really would not like to retake it this late in the game, as I feel like I would have to apply next year as opposed to this year to give myself time to study and retake the test.

Anyway, I've been out of work since then. I've been trying to get a job in the legal field (secretary sort of stuff) but those are hard to find in the really competitive area I live in (five minutes outside NYC). There are some jobs, but I've passed on ones where I felt the money was not worth the job (i.e. working for scummy lawyers). 

I put off going to law school after graduation because I wanted at least a year off. It's definitely something I want to do. 

My questions are these: 

- I came from a very large school in a large major, I haven't worked steady in awhile. I don't really have anyone I can get a recommendation from. **How much will this hurt me? What do I do with schools that want recommendations?**

- My stats are this: GPA: 3.4, LSAT: 161, minority student (if that helps anymore). I have my short list of schools I think I could get into, safeties, and reaches. **What would your recommendations be, as far as schools to apply to (with a strong bias towards NYC, D.C., and Boston.)?**

- **For current JDs, what's school like for now? Anyone at schools in the NYC area?** 

Anyway, thanks in advance for any help you guys give, hopefully someone will respond.

Thanks!

9739,37,"So I didn't have any work to do today, so I got the urge to play around with linux distros. I backed up my home folder, and wiped my drive.

I've been using Ubuntu for about 2 years. Before that I used fedora, suse, slack, debian, and mandrake. I own my own IT business and manage a bunch of linux servers regularly, so I'm by no means a linux noob.

But for the past 2 years, when it comes to my home desktop, Ubuntu has spoiled me in ways only Windows could. Everything simply works. I use the terminal a lot, but things are still simple in Ubuntu. Today I went through Debian, Crunchbang, Fedora, Arch, and one other that I already forgot. Each distro I found something that annoyed me, because it was SO simple to do the same thing in Ubuntu, and I had gotten so used to doing it the easy way, that I simply got frustrated having to do it the long way, and said screw it. Obviously Arch is going to be a nitty gritty distro, but even in Debian and Fedora I found things that annoyed me.

Well, what do you know, I'm currently setting up a new installation of Ubuntu on my desktop, as I'm typing this on my Bodhi-based netbook (yes, even a lightweight distro had to be based on Ubuntu for me to like it).

Have I gotten lazy? I don't know. Maybe having to deal with servers all day in the terminal, when I back out of it and just use MY computer, I guess it's nice to have everything simply work, without having to mess with much? Anyone here notice anything similar?"

Total (this is without shipping/tax or whatever, also without operating system):  $623 

I've ""made"" many hypothetical computers by picking parts out from Newegg, and now I have enough money to actually build one.  This is just a very very rough sketch, and I wouldn't be surprised if almost every part changes.  I picked these parts because they seem to match the kind of power I want, and it's below my budget, which is just around $650.  I wouldn't like to go much higher than that.  I already have a mouse, monitor, and keyboard.  As for the OS....I don't know what I'll do about that.  I want to leave it out of the equation for now.

So I'm sure there are many stupid errors with that list.  I'm not even sure if all those parts will work.  I'm pretty sure the power supply isn't good enough.  Is there anything on here that could be substituted by something superior for not much more money?  Or anything on here that I can swap out for something cheaper that's just as good?  Will the motherboard even be compatible with the CPU?

I'm having a good friend who's done this many times before help me, but I'd also like the opinion of Reddit.
Also, using that list as a sketch for price and power, do you think that could run Starcraft II on higher settings?  What kind of power am I looking at there?  I don't want to go through with it if that's not going to give me results enough to run the kind of games I want (Amnesia, Starcraft II, etc, on some of the higher settings).

Sorry for making you read all that!  Sorry if this list is super stupid, and I have no idea what I'm doing!  Thanks!

EDIT: Oh, and the harddrive is ""bare""- guessing that means OEM, and that it comes with nothing.  Will I need any other supplies, like a SATA cable, to connect it?  Or does something on my list already come with one?  What about tools?  Will the CPU come with whatever glue it needs, or will I have to purchase that separately? What else do I need so my list is complete enough that I can start building the moment it all arrives on my doorway?

Hi Ms. redacted:
 
Hope all is well with you and your family. We are all doing ok and Nich is doing the best he can, given the circumstances of his disease.  He has not been sick lately, but his cognitive abilities have continued to decline.  There is still no treatment and no cure for this horrible disease.  As a result, we (parents of children with Sanfilippo Syndrome) have resorted to trying to win grants to get research for a treatment and/or cure in hopes of saving our children's lives.  If a treatment and/or cure is not found within our children's lifetimes, hopefully in the future, a cure will be found so that parents won't have to sit by and watch their children die a horrible death.  We have entered a contest to try to win the Pepsi Refresh Grant for $250,000 to begin research.
 
Nich's flyer is attached below.  Please spread to as many people as you can (if you don't mind); we need to win the $250,000 for research.  We don't need money, just votes to win.  I have a facebook page and people can vote from there also. I would greatly appreciate your help.........it is much appreciated.

1039,467,"In Raiders, he's rescued because he has a plane waiting in the river, near the temple. What was that plane doing there, just over the hill from the Hovito temple? We know Jones didn't fly there since (A) we see him and his companions trekking through the jungle a lot farther than the distance from the plane, and (B) the plane only had room for Jones and the pilot. So that means Jones had to know the location of the temple in advance and told the pilot where to meet him, and that he had no intention of taking his companions along after he got the idol. The obvious conclusion to draw is that he knew in advance that the area was filled with booby traps and wanted companions along to use as catspaws to trigger them. If any of his men survived the temple, they'd be left for a Hovito stewpot.

In light of these facts, we must also reconsider the actions of Alfred Molina's character, Satipo, who betrayed Jones in the temple. To a viewer who accepts Spielberg's manipulative telling of the story, Satipo is a rat bastard who betrayed Jones. But obviously he twigged to Jones' plan and decided to beat him to the punch.

Thankfully there was a reputable archaeologist on the scene, who, though he failed to save poor Satipo, stopped Jones from stealing the Hopito's rightful property and heritage. If Belloq hadn't been foolish enough to take a Nazi grant for his expedition, he'd be the hero of the movie. As it is, the only thing Jones has going for him is that he hates Nazis, which isn't a particularly high bar.

&gt; The code is there, written in C, not compilable as is (built with PSL1GHT), but authors of Backup Managers are welcome to incorporate the ""LogJam"" Stealthing routines. It's packaged for installation with KMEAW firmware. If somebody wants to repackage it for others, go for it.

I've flipped over bikes onto gravel, slammed my hand down on a stove, hit my thumb with a hammer, etc. all because I wanted to know what it felt like. 


In one of my darker spots of my depression, I was in 7th grade and started cutting. I realized that it gave me a little shock every time I would cut, especially on my palm and fingers. I soon became curious in cutting in different places on my fingers just to see how each shock felt.


Do I regret all of these? Of course, the shock from these felt good for only like a second. A week in pain sucks. But it felt like a real version of curiosity killed the cat?"

Search for the term ""[Hindu Statesman](http://www.google.com/search?q=Hindu+statesman)"", and Rajan Zed is the third result! 

Apart from the fact that the term ""hindu Statesman"" is a misnomer at best and a oxymoron at worst ( because Hindu is a religious term, and statesman is apolitical term), this guy has no locus standi to speak as a voice of any Hindus, let alone all Hindus.

No one in India has even heard about him.  All the stories about him, [like this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ewxai/hindu_leader_gives_thumbs_up_to_paul_mccartneys/), are a result of him releasing press releases and nothing else.

Anyone who has anything to do with the media will tell you how easy it is to make a ""press release"" - all you have to do is label a document as press release, follow a particular format, and you have a press release. This guy releases a press release on almost all news-stories where Hinduism is mentioned, and almost always he makes stink over nothing. 


Some people have been on to him, for example [this blog](http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=14382&amp;s=Forum), which mentions that, 

&gt; ... has dismissed Zed’s reaction as “a tempest in a teapot created by a **self-promoting Hindu leader who does not represent South Asians in the US**

But that is not enough to stop him from perpetuating the myth that he is anything more than some Indian origin dude with an internet connection and a lot of time on his hands.

Sure he is also popular also as a the dude who was heckled by some Christians right wingers in the US Senate, but this only means that he is an Indian dude with a Secretary who has an internet connection who posts these press releases.

Rajan Zed is a fraud, and represent no one but himself, and 10 of his relatives, if that at all. "

But, as it is, all of the emotional heft they built up in the first half is sucked out of it for the climax (giggity).

Things I noticed (obviously, major spoilers):

* Monster man: nuff said

* They should have developed the relationship between the physicist and the last girl more.  They had a few scenes implying a more emotional connection, but then at the end he literally just leaves her to die alone on the side of the bomb.

* Although pretty space explosions are fun, I think the 'jump' from the life-raft to the bomb would have been MUCH more poignant if the ship hadn't been destroyed, but instead started its trip back to earth without a crew. A bit more highlighting that he decided to jump to the bomb even though he had a viable way to get home would take it even further.  Some tweaking of the air supply subplot would obviously be needed.

* Seriously...a monster man?

* The fact that the physicist was a father and family man should have been highlighted more...I completely missed this the first time I watched the movie.

* GET YOUR RELIGION OUT OF MY SCIFI, seriously...fuck *everything* about the monster man.

[Minor spoilers] In Pitch Black, an unusual solar system has a planet where the suns never set, except once every twenty years for a month. In its sequel, escaping prisoners must run on hellish terrain to reach a ship before the sun catches up and fries them. In Dante's Peak, a volcano surprises a town.

I began to ponder the ""courtesy flush"" and whether or not it might be a good time to implement it. I normally don't use the courtesy flush, as my toilet is pretty reliable and very rarely gets clogged, but I very seriously considered using it today. As I began debating whether or not to go ahead and flush while still on the pot, I began to wonder what reddit would think and how many out there ever go to this method in times of uncertainty. Perhaps some people use it quite often? Maybe there is a group of people who almost always give themselves a flush before wrapping things up with the cleanup process. I think this needs addressed.

And to show how little attention I give to this technique, my mid-decision making distraction that led to my focus on reddit ended up causing me to forget all about actually enacting the courtesy flush myself.

Maybe I'm the only one this irks, but I feel like nominating women for playing family roles is weak. Milas Kunis did some crazy good work in Black Swan, and so did Lesley Manville in Another Year. Instead, only those with a role in the family (and not always a family I'd want, Jacki Weaver ಠ_ಠ) got noticed.

So before we start on about the prism glass in which I view the world, I want to say yes, I am aware that woman can be any number of great things. I don't see them as gender roles first, so I'm not trying to stereotype the women nominated as being 'only' family. They're all very well crafted characters, acted out with nuance, and are indisputably good. My point is that their purpose, their character arc, and their significance to the main character all stem from a 'family' relation. It just seems too safe when choosing people to nominate.

tl;dr - Milas Kunis got screwed."

But, then I thought. _Why?_ Since battery life is fucking awful and requires hours of setting up your device (from zero experience) it seems like it would be common to turn off 3G, as every fucking app wants to phone home. So, people start turning off Internets, and then they open a free app... and no ads load.

[James Gilliland](http://www.eceti.org)

* [As You Wish Talk Radio](http://www.bbsradio.com): This is my favorite show that James does. It is live and when you listen to it you are able to, in a way, connect directly with James' energy. This isn't a claim he makes or anything, just something I have noticed when contrasting the feel of his two shows. Great guests and really ground zero for the independent contact movement. Live only every Saturday at 8:00 Pacific (10:00 Central, 11:00 Eastern).

* [Contact Has Begun on World Puja Network](http://www.worldpuja.org): This is James' other program hosted by World Puja. Another excellent resource, pre-recorded. Comes on every Tuesday, and you must listen to it the same day if you want it for free. James actually has to pay for his BBS show, whereas World Puja provides the service for free. Don't hesitate to support this great website if you want access to the archives (but same goes for BBS).

[Steven Greer](http://www.cseti.org)

[Also...](http://www.disclosureproject.org)

* [Conversations with Dr. Steven Greer on World Puja](http://www.worldpuja.org): Another good resource, Dr. Greer is truly a trailblazer in the field of ET contact, having coined the term CE-5 (close encounter of the 5th kind) which means contact initiated by human beings. His show can be very repetitive and Dr. Greer is a very controversial figure, but the fact remains that through The Disclosure Project and other efforts he has done more work for disclosure than just about anyone else in the field. I listen to his show for general updates and to see what he is up to. I believe it comes on the first and third Friday of every month. You must listen to it on the same day it is released if you want it for free.

[Billy Meier](http://www.futureofmankind.co.uk/Billy_Meier/Main_Page)

* Personally, I am not a fan of Billy Meier and there are many things about his case and claims that do not resonate with me, namely the exclusivity in his prophecies and the cult-like mannerisms exhibited by some of his followers. Overall, I think he made legitimate contact at some point and has since been influenced by negative entities or groups via channeling. This is only my opinion and some others here have expressed legitimate respect for this man and his prophecies. I don't want anyone to just take my word on it, because I'm just a person and I could be wrong. If you are interested, read up on your own and come to your own conclusions.

I first learned of David in a YouTube video called The 2012 Enigma. He seemed insane with all the claims he was making, but as I slowly began to learn more about him I saw that he is truly a resource worth keeping up with. Believe it or not, he is almost certainly the reincarnation of the great Edgar Cayce.

* [Project Camelot / Project Avalon](http://www.projectcamelotportal.com): An indispensible resource for truth seekers and those who want to know what is happening on the planet. Consists of whistleblower interviews as well as interviews with people who are generally in-the-know or have an interesting perspective. Lots of info, and Kerry tends to have a pretty set worldview, so just pick up the info that resonates with you and leave the rest. Whistleblower testimony is a strange thing and never 100 percent accurate, because it is afterall coming from human beings with their own distorted perspectives.

7581,23,"Things I think should happen:

1) Education should be overhauled to require personal finance as a class required for graduation. The dropout age should be increased to 18 and truancy laws should be enforced. We are America. There is no excuse to have under a 99% graduation rate in our country.

2) Birth Control should be available for free (I think this is more conservative to be honest, because it would keep people off welfare programs). Abstinence only programs should lose all funding because it is a religious program. The best way to prevent poverty is to avoid pregnancy during your teen years.

3) Military spending shouldn't be cut, a cut would imply a flesh wound. It needs to be slashed like the first victim in a horror movie and we should move towards a trade with everyone, ally with no one. Alliances just draw their allies into unwanted wars. The only part of the military that shouldn't be cut is NASA. 

4) The first 30k or so of income should not be taxed at all. If you make 250k a year, anything over that should be taxed much more heavily. This should continue to scale up. If you are making 5 million a year somehow, then your rate for your next dollar should be much higher than the person making 250k a year.

5) Drugs should be legalized. This would eliminate a very large percentage of crime in the ghettos. People could buy drugs for the real price. People aren't knocking off gas stations for alcohol or cigarettes, when they do, its a serious crime and they go to prison. When someone is just using drugs at their home or at a park, its not really a problem. Prostitution should also be legal and the sex offender registry should be eliminated. Drinking age should be 18 or 16. Maybe even 14 or 15. Parents should never be punished for providing a safe place in which their children and their friends can drink.

6) Custody should always be a 50/50 split by default, if a parent is proven unfit or doesn't want the kid then it can be adjusted. Child support should be eliminated for anyone who partakes in the 50/50 split. Those who don't should pay child support at a reasonable rate, relative to the time they spend with custody of their child. 

7) Police officers should be punished more harshly when they break laws than the average citizen because they have been granted the public's trust and betrayed it.

8) Diplomacy should be open. Wikileaks cablegate never should have happened because that kind of information should have been widely available in the first place. With an open process, we are giving ourselves an edge. We aren't forced to make backroom deals with some dictator because they have something held over our head. Instead the world should be able to see any attempt to extort us. It will also ensure that other countries don't try to slip in extras for their leaders, since the process would be open for all to see. 

9) Zero tolerance has no place in schools. Kids should be able to fight, get dusted off and then forced to shake hands. This kind of policy leads to school shootings. The pressure just builds and builds and builds in these kids snap instead of just fighting and settling it on the spot. 

Finger guns, lego guns, books about guns, drawing a picture of your hunting trip with your dad should not get you suspended or reprimanded. Scary stories are just that, stories, they aren't threats. They shouldn't be treated like they are... it seems that our administrators are more concerned with kicking out students than educating them. There is no place for that in a civilized and functioning society. An administrator's pay should be based on their schools graduation rate, including dropouts and expulsions. 

10) Everyone should shit sunshine and fart rainbows.

My understanding of the HUP is that the methods used to measure the position of an electron (no idea what those are exactly) are of such a nature that it is impossible to precisely measure the same particle's momentum (again, not sure of the methods) simultaneously (and vice versa).

Now what I understand of quantum entanglement is that when certain groups of particles decay, two particles become ""entangled"" so that you cannot accurately describe one particle without mentioning the other (not sure of the meaning of this). Also, any data collected on one particle such as its spin pattern will have a perfect negative correlation with data collected from the other.

**Now my question**: let's say you had two electrons that were quantum-ly entangled, let's say electron A and electron B. Could you not simultaneously measure the position of eA and the momentum of eB and infer that:

**p**eB = -**p**eA

Therefore learning the position and momentum of electron A at the same time?

1159,85,"From Wikipedia:  

    1.if God is unable to prevent evil, he is not omnipotent  
    2.if God is not willing to prevent evil, he is not good  
    3.if God is willing and able to prevent evil, then why is there evil?  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilemma#Epicurus.27_trilemma  

So, I will posit two counters to this, one from each fundamental   school of thought:  

1) Predestined Reailty - The 3rd part of the trillema collapses if God  has created each of us with the intention of glorifying His salvation of the elect that he grants salvation to. As such, what is claimed to evil in the world, is not evil at all, it is simply contrast color added to elevate the greatness of God's gift of salvation to the elect.  

2) Free Will Reailty - God has voluntarily limited His intervention in the world in order to provide us with the gift of free will. As such, while God is able to prevent evil, He does not in order to allow the gift of free will to all people. In this case, the second premise of the trillema collapses as God may very well be willing to prevent evil, but is inclined to allow it (evil) in exchange for the gift of free will to us. In order to restore the trilema, it must be shown that it is good to prevent evil by removing free will, which in turn would return to my first counter argument.   

My conclusion is that the Epicurus Trilemma is summarily false.

Let me start off by saying I COMPLETLY UNDERSTAND. Dude's trying to protect his kids from what he thinks is a creepy senior preying on younger girls. Fact is, I'm not. I know that, she knows that, now It's a mtter of convincing him.

I understand, this is no easy task. A father is given the ability to protect his family when the kid is born, and seeing some kid come in and look sketchy around his daughter would not fly very well. So I've started coming up with the good things about me that I can emphasize while minoring the negatives. Because I am meeting him Saturday at the show choir competition he's going to be at.

If he talks to me, or the girl in question introduces me, I've got a plan on what to say thought out. If I'm asked about my future, What I'm going to do is talk about my college plans, how I want to major in photography and minor in business, how I also want to teach, and that I've got my own photography business around town right now. I'm going to shave, get a hair cut, wear my nice collared button up shirt and my dress pants, and clean myself up in other ways. 

But waht else can I do? What else can I do to convince this father that I'm not the creepiest man on the planet? How can I make myself seem good? usually I just rely on my charisma or similar tastes in art or music, but Idk, this is the first father I've come across that I've had this problem with because this is the first girl younger then me I've been interested in.

8884,167,"I just picked up a i5 2500k, and the heatsink came pre-greased with thermal paste. I think I have some arctic silver around somewhere, would it be worth the trouble of cleaning off the old heatsink and applying that? I know it isn't THAT much work, but it can be a pain to get that ish off. Plus, they did a damn good job at applying it...

On a side note, how safe is a stock heatsink to overclock on?  I have heard of people having success with the [Hyper 212+](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835103065), would it be worth getting?  I am not aiming at insane speeds, probably more around the 4.0-4.2 ghz range.  I'm OC'ing mostly for curiosity reasons..."

* $275 used treadmill from craigslist, with nifty side supports included.

Have walked one mile. 192 lbs, 5'11"" male. Though I used to lift, I've been off the wagon for years. Diet started 6 days ago - 1600 cal, focus on reducing carbohydrates (though ketosis is not the goal).

7039,576,"I'm going to be getting a new HDTV soon.  Probably the longest I'll wait is for the pre-Superbowl sales.  My budget is, at most, ~$800 - though I'd prefer to stay under that, the $600-700 range would be much more comfortable for me.

I know I want a 40"" or 42"" set - bigger than that would be silly for my viewing area.

I want full 1080p, no less than 3 HDMI inputs, and would prefer at least 2 sets of composite and component inputs.  

I've been mostly looking at LCDs (and leaning towards Samsung, as I have a Samsung BD-C6500 Blu-ray player that brand affinity would be nifty for), but am now confused a bit by the addition of LED LCDs, and I may be open to Plasma as well, as I've read some positive things about Panasonic plasmas.

This is likely going to be a TV to last me 3-5 years minimum, so I want something that I'll be happy with and can have a reasonable expectation of quality and reliability.

I don't care about 3D at all.  

I watch mostly TV and movies, anime, and occasional sports (not too much on the sports).  Eventually, console gaming will be a factor as well.

On LCDs, I have these questions:

* 
What's the practical difference/benefit between 60hz and 120hz refresh rates?  

* 
What's the big deal on LED LCDs?  How noticeable a difference is there between the two?  Is it worth the difference in cost?

* 
On brands, again, I've been leaning towards Samsung, with Sony and LG also looking pretty good.  Are there others that I should look at?  TCL or Vizio?

For Plasma:

* 
Do Plasmas have the longevity for me to consider one as a TV that may need to last me for 5 years?

* 
Do Plasmas have additional/ongoing costs, maintenance, part replacements, or something that should be a factor to consider?

Help and info on this so I can make a solid buying decision would be very appreciated."

  Does this happen to a lot of people?  What if someone simply doesn't have the smarts to get a GED?  They could put people on probation for life this way.  My sister has a job and two kids, and simply doesnt have the time to go to school or prepare for a GED.  Is there any way to get out of this?

**How the players got here:**

The three 2010 GSL Open Tournaments were to increase interest in SC2 and to determine who the top players were based on repeat performance. [The points were tallied](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/GSL_Rankings) and players 1-32 were seeded into this Code-S tournament. Players 33-64 were seeded into the Code-A tournament.

**How the 2011 GSL Tournament works:**

The tournament workflow is [best described by this chart](http://i.imgur.com/Ev5Jc.jpg) (thanks to adremeaux/puzzl). Note that there is also a separate Code-A tournament which is not pictured. The Code-A tourney is a normal single elimination format with 32 players for January.


**A note on The Code-A Tourney:**

     Ro32 through Semis: Bo3
     Finals: Bo7

Players who make it to Ro16 will be seeded into next season's tournament. The rest have to go through the open preliminaries/qualifiers for Code A next season. Players who reach Ro8 will play in the ""up and down"" matches against the Code-S players. The top 2 players will get to choose their opponents from the pool of ""up and down"" matches.

**A note on Code-S Ro32 Group Stage:**

     Player A = Previously Ranked 1-8
     Player B and D = Previously Ranked 17-32
     Player C = Previously Ranked 9-16

     Match 1: Player A vs Player B
     Match 2: Player C vs Player D

     Winner of match 1 vs Loser of match 2
     Winner of match 2 vs Loser of match 1
     
Top 2 players advance into Ro16 and stay in Code-S for next season. Players with 2 losses are dropped to the up-and-down matches to determine their Code for next season (see the chart linked above).

* If two players are 2-0 and two are 0-2, each tied pair plays a tiebreak game. (6 games total)

* If the outcome is 2-0, 1-1, 1-1, 0-2, the tied players play for the tiebreak. (5 games total)

* If all four players are tied 1-1, the two pairs of players who haven't faced each other will play. The previous result between newly tied players is used as a tie-break. (6 games total)

This means that there will be no endless tiebreaks and no games where a player is playing for nothing, like with normal round-robin format. Every match will be an important rank-deciding match.

10345,540,"Woo Hoo! What a fun night! :D

Started out meeting a couple friends at a bar that was having a gay night. It was mostly gay guys plus a handful of straight people, so no targets for me. I got there before my friends did and was in a great mood. Started talking to some guy within a few minutes of getting my beer (from a really nice bartender I befriended previously). No opener other than a big stupid grin on my face when they guy looked my way. Had a nice time chatting with him until my friends showed up. We were hanging out having a few beers, then when they went out to smoke I flashed another big smile to a different guy and he called me over to chat. Part of me didn't like being summoned, but what the hell, he was just a dude, not a target, so I went over. He was really drunk but fun to talk to until my friends came back. I was planning on going to this club after the bar and though my friends were going to come too, but they ended up being tired and not in the mood to hit the club. So, left them not long past midnight and went to the club alone. 

I was really pumped for this club which is only on every couple months. It's not a gay club, more of a fetish/goth/drag queen crowd, but quite a few gay people there since this is a small city with not a lot of gay stuff going on. I arrive at the club and got myself a beer. The DJ was spinning some killer house tunes and I just hung out for a few minutes and checked out the room. Before long I flashed a big smile at another dude who came over and talked to me and bought me some drinks. Kept telling him I was gay, but he was buying anyway. So, had another beer and a couple shots. Yea, getting kind of drunk, but I was more out to party than score, so it was cool. Then after a bit I left him to go to the bathroom. Big fucking line, waiting forever. Then these two girls, one of them a smokin hot HB9 (friend was an HB7) came a long and tried to jump ahead of everyone. I was near the front of the line by that time and went over to send them to be back of the line. The friend of the HB9 started making excuses about how bad she had to piss, but I was like no fucking way and asked them where the money was. They didn't get it, so I clarified and said that if they wanted to jump ahead they had to pay me 100 kroner. They seemed to find this hilarious. Started chatting with the HB9. Just the usual where are you from stuff. She seemed straight, but was also telling me how awesome I looked and her friend looked kinda gay. So wasn't sure about her orientation. Then when a toilet finally opened up of course I went first and left them there. I was fast and got in and out before another one opened up. They were all ""I love you"" when I came out so fast and let them in after me. 

I felt like waiting for them, but knew that would be lame, so went out and hit the dance floor instead. Just danced and joked around with some people. I'm not a very good dancer and am a tiny bit nerdy for such a hip place, but seemed to attract people just because I was having fun. Then I spotted the HB9 and her friend and headed their way. The HB9 gives me a big smile and a hug and tells me I'm wonderful. (Yea, she was kinda drunk.) We talk some more and her friend wanders off. I really don't know where this girl is at, if she's into me or just an overly friendly straight girl. But, whatever, couldn't ask for better social proof. We part ways again, I talk to a couple random people, but I'm keeping my eye out for HB9. Then her friend spots me and says hello again, drags me over to a couch where the HB9 is. I politely ask the HB9 if I can sit next to her. I didn't need to, I was just being overly polite for her amusement. It worked, she grabs my arm and says I can sit next to her any time. Then she wanders off again and when she does her friend asks if I'm into the HB9. I say yea and ask if she's gay. The friend give me kind of a non-answer, so I still don't know where this girl's at. The HB9 comes back now and the friend wanders off. She was wearing this tiny skirt so was showing quite a lot of leg. I say ""nice skirt"" and run my hand up her thigh. She grabs my hand to stop me but is smiling and keeps holding on to my hand. So, I say WTF, and go in for the kiss. Success thankfully! There were a lot of people around, so I was extra glad to not get denied. But, when I'm kissing her I realise she's very likely straight and just being flirty and fun. It was just that for someone who seemed so into me her kiss wasn't horny enough. We make out a little bit until her friend comes back and taps me on the shoulder. I make some smart ass comment about asking her if she wants in too. The HB9 is acting a little embarrassed and now I'm sure she's straight. Her friend drags her off and I hit the dance floor again. I run into the guy who was buying me drinks earlier and just had fun dancing my ass off with him and whomever else was around until the place closed. 

It was really a shame the HB9 was straight, but that's just how it goes. It was one of the few nights since I started this PUA stuff where I thought I played the game pretty well all night. Like a BOSS!

The biggest appeal to me about the system is that you can just do more stuff with it and I am a nerd for that. I've been told to use unrEVOked and I'm curious how fool proof the setup is. Also do I do that over the air to my phone from the browser? Lastly my biggest reason for not doing it yet is my fear of messing anything up because I am already so happy with the phone, yet my inner nerd desires more.

9354,125,"I was fooling around with the feature that allows you to create custom game types (you can do all of this under the ""private match"" menu).

Anyway:

It's a FFA game (although it can be changed to TDM etc).

Killstreaks are all preset (i.e. you can't choose your own). They are as follows:

- 1 kill: Rolling Thunder
- 2 kills: Napalm Strike
- 3 kills: Mortor Strike

(Yes, the map will be full of destruction).

Perks have also been tweeked.

- Sleight of Hand allows you to reload 2x faster than the original.
- Steady Aim has a higher spread.
- For Second Chance, it takes 50 seconds to bleed out.
- Lightweight is faster.
- Flak Jacket is less useful.
- Other perks have been tweeked two. To ensure hardship.

Preset classes:

- Based on a class that a friend of mine made: **Herp Derp**. This class gives you 1000% health and an M60 with extended mags. The downside is, you move incredibly slow, you don't regain health and the damage you give other players is reduced. You're given a Tactical Insertion (works in private FFA) to help offset the time it takes to travel. If you see this class, you had better hope his/her health is low; otherwise you need to get the fuck on out of there.

- **Crack** This class can run ultra fast (no, seriously, I mean it). It's equipped with an Olympia and Sleight of Hand. Problem is, your health is 50% lower than usual and the speed, while sometimes helpful, will often prove to be annoying as hell.

- **Bomb Noob** A slow moving (not as slow as **Herp Derp**), noob-tube equipped, RPG-firing douchebag. Bullet damage is decreased by 50%. Explosive damage is increased. Health decreased by 50%.

- **M0NT4GE M4KER** Bolt action sniper rifle. Steady aim with the increased spread. Double damage. Health is reduced by 50% and I'm thinking of forcing the player to use a vehicle lock on launcher so that they are forced to use the sniper rifle. Currently has double speed but I'm taking that back out of it because it makes the class unfair.

- **Noobzilla** You get a Famas with silencer and red dot. Great, right? No. You also get Second Chance, which will give you a bleed-out time of 50 seconds. Harrowing if nobody managed to finish you off. You also move slower than usual and can only deal 50% of normal damage. Oh, and your health does not recover.

- Currently working on **awkward**. This will be a regular speed class. You'll be forced to use the Scorpion with a silencer and deal 50% less damage to enemies. You'll be given Scavenger Pro to give you more rounds.

Still thinking of more regular-speed classes. Feel free to add in some ideas so that I can make the most horrific game mode possible.

Also, if XBox users want to test it out: The game settings is in my fileshare.

4258,471,"Prinny 2 just released on the 11th in North America for PSP and is available on both UMD and digitally via the PlayStation Store. The game has been available on the European PSN since the middle of December.

However what has also been silently released this week is a free download via North American PSN to automatically unlock ""Asagi Wars"" which lets the player play as Asagi in an extended gameplay mode.

After downloading the patch for the game (which works for both UMD and digital versions) simply go to the main title screen, put the cursor over ""New Game"" and enter the code: ∆, □, о, ∆, □, о, ×.

Enjoy Asagi Wars for a bit of light entertainment when the main Prinny campaign gets too tedious.

Naturally, Asagi Wars mode unlocks after the successful completion of the game, so purists don't have to worry about missing out on any content if they choose not to use the patch+code combination.

The second, The Society of the Muslim Brothers is an Islamist transnational movement and the largest political opposition organization in many Arab states. The group is the world's oldest and largest Islamic political group, and the ""world's most influential Islamist movement."" It was founded in 1928 in Egypt by the schoolteacher Hassan al-Banna.

The Brotherhood's stated goal is to instill the Qur'an and Sunnah as the ""sole reference point for ... ordering the life of the Muslim family, individual, community ... and state""

So there you have it. One group wants democracy and the other wants a theocracy.

Kefaya is thought to be in disarray and weakened but the Muslim Brotherhood is strong and organized.

If, and it is a very big if given Mubaraks record for brutality and torture, Mubarak is forced out there is a very good chance the Muslim Brotherhood will hook up with the military and form a theocratic Government.

And the people will probably be worse off then they are now. At least Murbarak is keeping the worst religious excesses in check, if only to bolster is own position.

Most of her life, she worked as a nanny, but took over 100,000 photos while she lived. If she were still alive, I'd be curious to how she got so close to her subjects.

When I worked for a professional publication, it wasn't a big problem to tell people ""I'm from the newspaper."" Now I tend to back away from getting in people's faces, because of their (justified) apprehensiveness toward a stranger taking their photo for no professional reason. Maier was an amateur, do you think she just was more comfortable approaching strangers (it also was a different time, where you didn't have to worry that a random photo of you would appear on who knows what Internet site)? Or did she use a long lens for some of these photos?

This one is going to be interesting. The label describes it as “Ale brewed with Lemon Peel and infused with Espresso.” It’s by New Belgium, the same folks that brew “Fat Tire”, which is one of my favorites when I go out to restaurants. So let’s just jump right in.

**Appearance 4/5**

Dark golden brown in color. Nice cream colored head. Excellent lacing.

**Aroma 2/5**

Coffee. That’s it. Maybe my nose isn’t very refined but I couldn’t detect anything else. Coffee smells good but not what I’m looking for in a beer. I’ll go easy though because it’s got to be hard to bring out other scents with something as strong as Espresso in the mix.

**Palate 2/5**

Thin. I was a little disappointed in this area. When I think of coffee flavored beers I think of thick, heavy stouts. To be fair, this isn’t a stout but I still wish there could have been a little more to write about in this category.

**Taste 5/5**

WOW! Really?! Wow! I was expecting this to be overdone but everything is subtle and perfect. The first thing I noticed was the coffee of course but there is also a roasted nutty flavor to it. The lemon peals come in to play at the end, cutting the coffee bitterness short before it becomes to overbearing. There is not a hint of alcohol flavor. The only thing that reminds you that you’re drinking a beer is the slightly stinging sensation from the carbonation. Great job!

**Overall 13/20**

I wouldn’t drink this every night but as an interesting experiment, I was thoroughly satisfied. Beers this unique are rarely this refreshing, which after all, is the point of a beverage."

4811,678,"Okay, the truth is, glutumate is not a *direct* neurotoxin. It's an indirect neurotoxin. It opens up AMPA and NMDA receptors, allowing Calcium ions to rush in. And it's actually the calcium ions that are actually responsible for the neurotoxicity (IIRC, it has something to do with the Calcium getting into the mitochondria and making the mitochondria inner membrane more permeable, making free radical reagants more likely to ""leak out and combine"").

Now, what piracetam does is ""enhance the activity of AMPA receptors"". It also increases postsynaptic AMPA receptor density. So then what? I would think that it would result in an increased amount of calcium flux into the postsynaptic cell. And that can cause neurotoxicity.

I know that we don't know everything about piracetam yet, but I'd at least like to get this answered first.

The most upvoted song has a score of 448.
The most downvoted song has a score of -16.


The total average positive score (out of 1,613 submitted songs) is 6 with 288 songs in rotation greater than or equal to that average (7%); songs with above average scores (for their particular genre) have a higher probability of being played on the stream during a genre block.  The threshold (average positive score) is much higher per genre.


The average negative score is -2 with 74 songs less than or equal to that average (songs with -10 or lower are excluded from rotation).


1613 songs (40%) in rotation have been submitted to /r/radioreddit for votes.  2447 songs (60%) in rotation have not been submitted for votes.


This month there were over 10,000 downloads and song plays on http://radioreddit.com (this is site interaction, song previews and downloads - not plays on the live streams).


Our daily listenership on the live streams now peaks at over 50 listeners each day with hourly averages consistently around 30.  A year ago we had peaks of 5-10 listeners each day.

2863,390,"Today’s beer is Stone Brewery’s 13th Anniversary Ale; a beer they’ve nicknamed a “Big, red, hop monster” In fact, this is the hoppiest beer they’ve ever made according to their website. I wonder if they chose to make this beer extra hoppy because last year’s anniversary ale had relativley little hops due to a world wide shortage. Anyway, Let’s get right in to it.

I bought this in a 22 oz. bottle and I’m drinking it from a brandy snifter. I like to drink big aromatic ales from brandy snifters because they trap the aroma in the glass. The alcohol content is 9.5% ABV and it was double dry-hopped.

**Appearance 5/5**
This is a beautiful looking ale!
Starts off golden but quickly turns a deep dark crimson as it fills the glass. Suprisingly dark. The thick head is a medium tan.

**Aroma 5/5**
Exceptional! The main thing I noticed was the heavy hop aroma; an extremely *fruity* hop aroma. There is a hint of a malty scent as well but the citrusy hops are the main characteristic

**Palate 5/5**
PERFECT! Silky smooth like velvet. I was expecting a bitter biting sensation. This seemed to coat my mouth without being sticky. Finished with a pleasant drying sensation due to the high hoppiness.

**Flavor 5/5**
WOW! HOPS! They weren’t kidding, this really is the hoppiest beer they’ve ever made. I didn’t think I would like it but this was a pleasant surprise. I was expecting the hops to be cloying but that isn’t the case at all. The malty sweetness balances it all out perfectly. The first sensation I noticed was the bitterness, to be sure. But just when I though it was going to be too much, it mellowed out into a delicious sweet citrus flavor. As I swallowed, it evolved into a nice nutty/sweet malt flavor. The hops come back again later as an after taste that sticks around for quite a while, but not in an overbearing way. It left me wanting another sip (which I will take right now before I write up my conclusion…)

**Overall 20/20**
Stone, you’ve done it again. You’ve made the perfect beer. Like I said before I was expecting the intense cloying bitterness of Stone’s Hoppiest beer to date to ruin the experience for me. What I got was a shocking explosion of hop bitterness that quickly evolved and mellowed into a pleasant nutty/sweet sensation just before it became too strong for my liking. As usual, this beer should be sipped slowy over a deep conversation; it’s a thinking man’s beer. I’m glad I bought two bottles.

Sip slowly and enjoy in good company."

8054,362,"Every day, it becomes more and more clear that my grandmother is losing touch with reality, but I'd like to remember her in a better light. She worked for Fabergé much of her life, earning a menial wage at best. Her family came from Mexico, and as such, she became perfectly bilingual in English and Spanish. She was practically a Flapper, much passed the years of the Flapper; there are quite a few pictures of her with her late husband and their friends in clubs and at bars, dressed incredibly eloquently for what small salary they earned.

**Alternatively to ""what did they do with their lives?"", you could answer me this: ""what funny/awkward/cute things do/did you notice about your grandparents?""**

To answer my own question, my grandmother now lives in Texas, where she's had a plot of land that our family has owned for generations. There's a market there called HEB. Whenever she needs to go there (or more recently, needs someone else to go there for her), she always calls it the ""Heishee Bee"". Her pronunciation quirk always makes me smile without fail; no one else calls that store the Heishee Bee but my grandmother. It's the little things you cherish, you know?

EDIT (to include both sides of the family): My paternal grandmother lived quite a different life. She was born in Poland in the late 20s. Her and her husband, my grandfather, came to the States in 1960, with my father and two other children (they were aged 1 to 6). My grandmother has met many important people (the previous Pope, a former American President, etc.), yet remained very humble. My grandfather I know to be a hard-working man — a real man's man — very handy and very forceful. This grandmother, as well, has succumbed to Alzheimer's at the same time as my maternal grandmother. Her sunny smile and demeanor has been conquered by a rainy sense of lost determination. She's told me after working for most of her life, after raising four children and losing one, after losing all of her sisters and being the last alive, ""I had so much. I know there are things to remember, but they don't let me remember them."" My two grandparents, my babći and dziadziu, are about to celebrate their 60^th wedding anniversary, soon after having been in America for 50 years.

L'EDIT DEUX: I didn't include my maternal grandfather here. It's weird to think about him since I never met him, but his ""thanks for serving our country"" letter hangs in our hallway. He lied about his age to get into the US Airforce, cool beans, amirite? My grandfather also was married twice, which was very strange for his time period (he was born in 1906). He came from Peru when he was little, his grandfather being dictator (two times). He spoke Spanish, like my grandmother, but came from a prestigious family who completely disowned him when he chose to be with my grandmother, who was basically impoverished before she met him. Supposedly, he was a real troll dad; it's too bad I never met him.

So there's a lot I could write about my grandparents, but I'm much more interested in Reddit's stories. Tell me about your grandparents!"

8378,13,"This is an old story I wrote on another site a long time ago. 

It all started when I was home from leave my first year in the military. I had a friend ""Josh"" who (I found out from my friends who picked me up) figured out his dream was to be a hairdresser. Now this guy to the absolute best of my knowledge is not gay. But I guess different career paths for different people.But that did not stop me from skipping my hellos with the parents to go where he worked and tease the ever living shit out of him in front of his clients.

Upon arriving at his ""working establishment"" we proceeded to do our intentended task of laughing our asses off at him and then finally got to the hellos and all the pleasentries.

It was around 7:30 at night and he got off at eight so we figured we would wait a half hour for him, go grab beer and shoot the shit at my parents.

Well, while waiting he told us that it might take a little longer because every other week this 50 year old nasty hag came in at the last 5 minutes to get her hair cut and he had to do it. He told us that she would sit in that chair for an hour bitching constantly about how bad of a job he was doing. Yet two weeks later there she was at 7:55 jumping in the chair to do it all over again.

I told him we should fuck with her in a patronizing sort of way so maybe next time she might think twice about going back, without getting him in trouble in the process.

It was just as he said. She arrived 5 till 8:00 and started bitching. Well I figured I would throw the first stone to get it rolling. "" Mam, that is some really beautiful grey green hair you have there. Grow it yourself, do ya?""

You know what that old cunt said? "" Shut the fuck up little bald punk!"" Well that is exactly what I did. She scared the shit out of me! I was like a little dog with my tail between my legs. Big tail... but tail none the less.

After those ruined plans I decided just whisper with my two friends and wait. While talking, my friend mentioned some very unusual activity going on under the plastic hair deflector-catcher sheet thingy she was wearing. We sat for five minutes glancing trying to figure out what was going on. It looked like a hamster trapped in a sock or something.

We had to figure out what it was. So I decided to drop my keys to get a better look at the rabid presence from within. While doing so I figured out what it was. THE BITCH WAS PLEASURING HERSELF!!!

So of course I did the only respectable thing I could think of... I ripped the sheet off pointed and screamed with laughter! Of course my friends were to stunned to do anything for about four or five seconds,curiously about the same amount of time it took her to scream and haul ass out the door.

After everything died down a bit and we were at my parents he started to put two and two together. He noticed she would sometimes moan, but never figured that was why. Haircuts are relaxing, he just figured that was the reason. Come to find out she had been going there for 6 months.That is 15 times she has gotten off to him! I tried to convince him to call the cops and press charges for sexual harrassment. Get a little money for his troubles. But he wouldn't. I do not see him often since I live a half a world away now. But I do tell my mom to give him a moan for me whenever she sees him.

I'm turning 18 in a week, my little brother's turning 14 in a few weeks.  I'm 95% sure my parents' divorce is going to go through and I'm not totally sure what to expect, particularly with regard to custody.  I think my parents are going to try to resolve custody/child support/alimony with a mediator rather than in court (to save lawyer expenses) but I'm not totally sure that's going to happen.  With all that in mind:

1. Broadly speaking, what can I expect to happen if mediation happens?  What if it goes to court?  Will I get to/have to testify?

2.  Is custody even relevant for me given that I'm going to be 18?

3.  Will I have any say in my own custody?

4.  I'm worried about my little brother's ability to stick up for himself in court.  Will I be able to intercede on his behalf?  I'd much prefer he go with my mother.

TL;DR: My parents are divorcing, I'm 18, my little brother's 14.  What can I expect?"

Anyway, one summer I get a job as a lifeguard at the local pool.  I ended up really enjoying it.  To be honest, part of that was that I felt like I was in a position of power (even though I was never a jerk, no confidence for that).  And part of it was getting paid to stare at chicks.  But what was really cool was that I was working with a bunch of people a few years older than me (I was 16-17, they were 18-22).  And they treated me like one of their own, talked to me, didn't know my nerdy reputation, and seemed to like me.

I won't lie, I was still the quiet guy, but I was never made fun of, mocked, or excluded.  Heck, they even invited me to parties and stuff.  Girls talked to me.  I was playfully hit by a girl for the first time in my life.  When 3 girl lifeguards pushed me in the pool after hours and started giggling, it was the best moment of my life - I was part of the group!

My huge regret, my worst mistake, is that I didn't take advantage of that.  I didn't go to any of the parties.  I never kept up with anyone.  I didn't hang out with them outside work.  I lost touch. And I ended up going back to being made fun of and mocked all school year.  I just didn't have the confidence to engage with the other lifeguards as friends.

I'll also admit that there is an aspect to this post that is ""help me with this one girl"", but let's try to use my situation as an example and make it mostly about long distance seduction in general. I did a [field report](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/f2slz/fr_more_sweet_than_sexy_but_shows_pua_isnt_all/) describing my last meeting with this girl. But, the basic situation is not that unique. This isn't an online relationship or anything, rather someone I met in real life who has now moved pretty far away (a 2 hour flight). This is someone I'm looking to have a serious relationship with, otherwise I wouldn't bother. She is definitely attracted to me, but I'm not sure if she sees me as a potential romantic interest or not.

As I see it the main problem with long distance seduction is that the only opportunities for communication are electronic, and we all know that it's next to impossible to build attraction that way. But, what I am thinking is more how to maintain the level of attraction and increase curiosity/interest for the purpose of arranging real life meetings. 

So far, I've done a pretty decent job of following the ""online rules"" about not initiating contact more than she does and not giving away too much information and keeping things short. (Probably weaker on the last two points... some of which is just due to the fact that the way women communicate with each is different that how men and women do, more intimate mainly, and some of which is my fucking up. 

In my situation, I really like this girl but friend-zoned her a while back (a calculated move to do it before she did it to me). When we met again recently (see the [field report](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/f2slz/fr_more_sweet_than_sexy_but_shows_pua_isnt_all/) for details) there was definitely attraction still there. At this point, I really want her to un-friendzone her. But, I don't like the idea of trying to show how I feel electronically. The best out of those options is the telephone I think, but it's far from ideal. I don't really want to just call her up and tell her I like her as more than a friend, but I'm very close to doing that because I don't see another option. I think she needs to know something because other people are pursuing her, and if she still thinks she's in my friendzone, I have no chance at all.

So, any suggestions on how to communicate one's feelings and attraction in this type of situation? What's the least worst way? I know my chances are slim to none, but (like i said) I know myself and I'm going to do something (unless seddit talks me out of it)."

8687,656,"I've had this on my mind for a few weeks. 

I know that the Christian faith views homosexuals as sinners and holds that their relationships are detestable and evil. This is borne out (based on my limited understanding of the Bible) by the passages Leviticus 18:22 which states

&gt;*Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable.*

and by Leviticus 20:13 which states

&gt;*If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.*

I've also noticed that Christians tend to revile abortion under any and all circumstances. This is borne out by the verses Jeremiah 1:4-5 which states

&gt;*Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying: ""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; before you were born I sanctified you...*

and verse Luke 1:15, which states

&gt;*...and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.*

My question stems from the fact I've noticed that, whereas some rules from the Bible are held as hard-and-fast moral laws, other rules are held to be metaphorical. I'll include a few examples.

The rule which says all houses must have a parapet around the roof (Deuteronomy 22:8).

&gt;*When you build a new house, make a parapet around your roof so that you may not bring the guilt of bloodshed on your house if someone falls from the roof.*

The passage forbidding the eating of rare (bloody) meat (Leviticus 7:26-27)

&gt;*And wherever you live, you must not eat the blood of any bird or animal.  Anyone who eats blood must be cut off from their people.*

The passage which forbids haircuts and shaving (Leviticus 19:27)
&gt;*Do not cut the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard.*

The passages which forbid the eating of certain meats (Leviticus 11:6-12)

&gt;*The rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you. And the pig, though it has a divided hoof, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you. You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you. Of all the creatures living in the water of the seas and the streams you may eat any that have fins and scales. But all creatures in the seas or streams that do not have fins and scales—whether among all the swarming things or among all the other living creatures in the water—you are to regard as unclean. And since you are to regard them as unclean, you must not eat their meat; you must regard their carcasses as unclean. Anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales is to be regarded as unclean by you.*

My question, at length, is this:

How is it decided which rules in the Bible can be broken without it being a sin, and which rules must be followed in order to get into Heaven?

Case in point, how do Evangelical Christian groups justify their assertions that homosexuals and pro-choice organizations are immoral and should be purged from society, when they do not voice any objections to houses without parapets, restaurants and homes which serve meat rare, barbers and hair stylists, places which sell shaving devices, or restaurants and homes which serve things like rabbit, pork, and shellfish?

I’m genuinely curious. Why is it a sin for certain rules to be ignored, and seemingly not others? How is it decided which is which?"

(I am accountable for my first reactions as well and I made myself sick after thinking about it. I took this situation and felt good about it in some way.) Maybe so, but in no way is it ""fair"".  While I don't agree with them in any way I still agree that Palin etc. is saying the same type of things that people of all sides have said.

7099,209,"Consider me superstitious, dumb or whatever, but I just had it with FT. I've been complaining lately about extreme bad luck that wouldn't change, I decided to give it another chance. Many bad beats happened again. It was terribly frustrating to do everything well and lose money non stop. I won't get in the kind of hands that were beating me, but lots of those were 4:1, and just like always, all my flips I lost. After a period of 30 minutes and playing 6 tables, I managed to see the same hand 3 times; KK vs AA. What are the chances? It's not like it's the first time, I've been suspicious about that happening since long ago, too many times.

I know I can't prove anything, but I'm just fed up of having these beats continuously, without a break. Maybe I'm just crazy. 

I also saw a couple of websites that speak about what I'm saying but I don't know if there's truth in that 

http://fulltiltrigged.info/

http://fulltiltpokerrigged.blogspot.com/2009/08/full-tilt-rigged-confirmed.html

Anyway, as I made a PS poker club I ended liking more the interface, the kind of tourneys, it's easier on the eyes, etc. so I took my money out of FT and I'm waiting for it to arrive to put it on PS.

I played 5NL for about 6 hours without seeing those beats I saw in FT, everything was standard. Of course not always the best hand won at the end, but it happened in a very balanced way.

The only con is that the amount of playtime i put weekly would make me a silverstar, which will give about 13/15% of rakeback, instead of FT's 27%. Maybe if I manage to move up that'll change.

EDIT: Maybe I didn't explain myself well enough. I'm not stating as a fact that FT is rigged. I'm just telling how unlucky I've been, it's been disgusting and I don't wanna play in FT no more. I'm happier at stars now and I'm glad I made the change."

2036,96,"I was going through my basement over the weekend, and I found an old, stone and wood, tomahawk. I was instantly reminded of this. 

When I was 8 years old, I had a bully in my life. He was friends with my older brother, so rarely had the opportunity to beat me up too badly because my brother was usually around. He would constantly remind me that one day my brother wouldn't be there, and I would have to face him then.

It left me paranoid when walking home from school, I was always watching my back. I knew I would inevitably have to face him, but I didn't know how I would survive the encounter (He was 11 at the time and I was 8).

So my grandparents were at my house one random day, recently back from a vacation to the south-west, and they had brought a gift back for me. It was a genuine tomahawk, made from stone and wood. It was heavy as all hell and could do some serious damage. Show and tell was the upcoming Friday at school and I knew I would be the talk of the class if I brought it in, so I did.

I brought it in my backpack, and my mom called the school to let them know I was bringing a weapon (pre-columbine, she was ahead of her time), which they were fine with. I showed it to my class, who thought it was amazing, naturally, and carefully put it in my backpack as I left the class.

Walking out of school, I took my usual route home, but was met my my bully a block from school. He pushed me to the ground and told me how ""today is the day your going to die"". I was in total shock, and braced myself for a kick in the face.

Suddenly, I remembered what was in my backpack. I scrambled to grab the tomahawk before he struck me, and presented it to him like it was Excalibur, wielding it with two hands above my shoulder.

Now the bully was in shock. I saw the look on his face and took a step at him, judging his reactions. He was scared, and about to cry. He screamed and ran across the street, almost getting hit by a car. I put my tomahawk back in my backpack, and walked home in the best mood I had ever been in (insert ""fuck yea"" meme here).

After that, the bully slowly stopped hanging out with my brother, and never came over to our house again. He must have thought I kept the tomahawk on me at all times or something, but I never saw him on my way back from school ever again.

So, my boyfriend bought a '96 Cherokee (XJ) SE, for way too much, like around $3,000. It broke down and he has put another $2,500 in it and totally rebuilt the engine and did a lot of after market work on it. He has and will do all the labor himself, he refuses to pay for labor. Now, he finds out that the motor needs to be taken back out and fixed again and is looking at another $700. I said he should just sell it and wipe his hands clean, he says he won't make enough. 

Firstly, what is your guys' opinion on what he should do? Secondly, how much do you think he could make parting it versus just the whole car as is?

Thanks for your guys' opinions!

**First Reply**

You want my opinion? Ok…

Shut the hell up. You’re not his wife. You’re not paying for the repairs. It’s absolutely none of your business what he does with his Jeep or his money. I know your type well… first it’s “Sell the Jeep because it’s costing too much money.” Then it’s “No, you can’t go spend the weekend with your buddies because I need you to take me shopping.” Then it’s “Oh gee, honey… I’m pregnant. Gosh, I have no idea how that happened.”

You’re a DreamKiller. You kill a guy’s dreams, take away his future, tie him down with a fat mortgage and too many babies, and turn him into just another miserable guy wondering, “How the hell did I get here?”

Do you really want to help him? Here’s what you do… go to your local library (it’s a big building with books inside) and check out a couple of books on rebuilding engines. Read them, over and over, until YOU understand what needs to be done. Then help him get that engine out and rebuild it. Tie your hair back in a ponytail, put on some old jeans and get your hands dirty. Hand him wrenches, hold the light, pull the wire connectors apart, help him get the hood off… help him with anything he needs. When he gets tired, run inside and make him a hot lunch or dinner. Fix him coffee, hot chocolate, whatever he wants. (But NO beer. Beer is for when the job is done.)

Then when the day is over and you’re both exhausted from working on the engine, push him into a hot shower and jump in with him. Scrub his back, wash his hair, rinse him off, and dry him with fluffy towels still hot from the dryer. Then push him into bed and screw his ears off. Then get up the next day and do it all over again. 

Make him realize that rebuilding an engine is a slow and methodical process. Make him realize that every step should be regarded as surgery; every step must be perfect… perfect torque, perfect fit, perfectly clean. If you run into a step that you just can’t figure out, ask for help from someone who knows what he’s doing. Are you cute? Put on a low-cut top, show some cleavage and go (by yourself) to the local Jeep shop, and explain to the guys that you are helping your boyfriend to rebuild his engine and neither of you can figure out this one little step, and do they have any advice…

Think it won’t work? Think again. We guys love to help cute girls, even if they have a boyfriend. (Hey, maybe you’ve got a sister, or girlfriend…)

But absolutely DO NOT whine or complain. Do not say a single negative thing. Not a single “Oooooo, I broke a nail.” If you break a nail, or cut your finger, or bang a knuckle, you just shut up and DEAL WITH IT. You should be a hopelessly optomistic, never-say-die cheerleader, encouraging him every step of the way.

That’s my opinion.

There is a ""world renowned"" priest by the name of Father Suarez, who claims to be a healer.

10216,385,"Same as the FR I posted on main Seddit, not sure if we should just be mirroring FR or what.

Los Angeles Seddit arranged a little meetup at Boulevard 3 in Hollywood last night at a USC/UCLA/Caltech party. I got there right when the doors opened so I had all sorts of time and space to myself, especially since the line exploded and the others were waiting over an hour to get in.

So I'm cruising around and I feel some AA start to kick in. It doesn't seem to matter much though, since for some reason girls are opening me. A brunette and her blonde friend walk up behind me while I'm in line at the bar and declares ""Hi!"" The directness of her approach catches me off guard and I'm a little shocked, so I try to play it off by asking about the way she put her hair up. She gives some response, then asks what school I go to, I tell her USC. ""Oh, so you're loaded then!"" and she puts her arm around me. I sense where this is going, so I say ""I'm gonna disappoint you here, but being loaded doesn't mean I buy drinks for just anyone who walks up and puts their arm around me."" ""Please,"" she responds, ""we don't need your money! We can buy all our drinks ourselves."" Again, I'm a little caught off guard, so I say something to the effect of ""...yeah, that's what's going to happen."" My problem here is something I keep encountering: I'm trying too hard to ""challenge"" her. Challenging her is an idea I keep hearing over and over, but I think that I'm coming across too much as cocky and arrogant. There seems to be a balance that I'm not striking, especially in this particular scenario, because the girl turns away and goes ""you're kind of a jackass."" I'm naturally a very nice and cooperative person, almost to a fault, so my tendency when meeting girls is to overshoot in the opposite direction. Pretty sure the only way to tend to this is lots and lots of social interaction, and the balance should hopefully come over time.

Anyway, I head to the dance floor, and an asian girl off to the side and I catch eyes. We hold gaze for a second, and she comes over to meet me. I quickly pull her onto the dance floor, and she's getting pretty physical. But when I try to escalate too far, she puts up a barrier. I go in for a kiss and she politely shrugs me off. So I back off, freeze her out a bit, I let her come to me and grab and my arms and clothing. To play it off I take turns with her picking out hot guys and girls on the dance floor that either of us would go for. She's pointing out cute girls, so I tell her we're going to set her up with one. I go tapping on girls shoulders telling them my friend wants to dance, then pulling her over and putting the two of them together. The whole time I'm whispering advice in her ear like ""dance sexy!"" and ""put your arms around her!"" When the two of us are dancing together I also drop little hints like ""Just so you know I've got really high standards in women"" and ""you're going to have to earn me."" Do you guys think this is coming off as alpha or just arrogant? Anyway, she seems into it, but she has to leave because of a biology project she forgot to take care of. As she's leaving she tells me to have a good time, and I say that the best moments of your life are the ones you remember forever, what am I going to remember you by? Then we kiss, and I send her on her way.

Shortly thereafter, withClass arrives and I meet up with him and Cptncrnch. Class and I begin making the rounds now that more people are here, and man, what a difference having a wing makes! Earlier when I was on my own, I was there just to meet people, so when I wasn't meeting people I wasn't having fun. Now that I was hanging out with someone I really enjoyed, I was having fun all the time. The (awesome) corollary of that is that the more fun you're having, the more willing you are to go up to new people. From then on I had no fear at all about approaching women since I knew that if we got blown off, I'd have a friend there to laugh about it with. We opened a few sets and tried to pull some girls onto the dance floor, but didn't have much success. Part of it comes down to the fact that I just don't care much for the kinds of girls who go to these big club events, so a relatively small number seemed to share my energy. But like I said, I had no worries whatsoever because I was having a great time in general. I told one girl that her dress looked like a watermelon exploded on it, and told another bullshit facts like how asparagus grows six feet high in Alaska. Just enjoying myself. Having Class around was fantastic and I can't wait to go out again, especially to work on day game and situations other than clubs.

I think [LA Seddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngelesSeddit/) has a lot of potential, I'd love to see guys getting each other going out and having fun. If you've never been out with someone else who wants to improve their game, it's a must. Class and I will be setting up new events soon, and I'd love to hear from anyone with ideas, thoughts, or suggestions for meetups. I'd love to meet as many of you as I can!"

My bill was $190 (Canadian) per month!  To me, that was outrageous!  I set on a quest to lower that bill. 

I changed all my lightbulbs to fluorescent bulbs; I made sure to unplug any unused appliances (not the fridge, stove, dishwasher, washer or dryer, since I can't reach these plugs easily); I keep all the lights off except in the room I'm happen to be in; I bought drying racks instead of using my dryer; and I don't run major appliances (washer/dishwasher) during peak hours.  I managed to get my bill down to $149/month, which was a good accomplishment, but I'd like it to be lower. 

I'd like to know if anyone has any other suggestions on how to lower my power bill that won't cost me a lot of money.  

I've looked into getting a central heat/air conditioner unit since my home is quite cold in the winter, but they cost $6000 to install.  I looked at getting solar panels to heat my water, but that costs $4000 to install.  It would be worth it in the end, but I don't plan on living in this house forever, and that's a large initial cost.

Any advice on who I should be speaking with to get the idea designed into product concepts or technical designs or whatever?

3041,579,"I definitely learned a lot from using my female shills and here are some of the advantages. Will expend on them through out the day.

Everyone, both girls and guys, wrote back to kittens so it was easy for me to:

**1) Sniff out suspected shills.**

Usually when I see a really young, hot girl with a rather blank profile I assume it could be fake. So I try to engage in conversation with her about the site itself. And if they reply back then I assume they are legit, because if a fake account holder would put the put to message me back like a real girl would then he would have put more time into the profile in the first place.

**2) Figure out what that hot girl is like**

This sort of branches out from 1. Remember the post about the wingman? It does  pretty much the same thing.

**3) Spot the competition in my are and see what they are messaging**

Right off the bat, 99% of the messages are shitty as hell. This only teaches me what not to write as opposed to what to write.

And let's just talk about the titles of the messages. On some days, I don't even feeling like opening up most of my messages unless I can tell the sender is cute from the thumbnail picture. My friends think I act like a high school girl so I'm guessing that means my behavior is pretty representative of hot girls'.

Most of the message titles, I'd say 90%+ are hi or some stupid one word greeting.

The second most common title are keywords lifted from my profile a direct question regarding those keywords. Better than hi but I highly doubt a girl is going to be excited.

Some people use the extra space in the title to write their first sentence. This also feels unexciting.


I've seen people write ramble assortment of words just trying to come off as quirky but in reality I felt it was annoying.

3 is a huge topic on its own. Basically having a shill lets me know what kind of message work, are over used, and will not work. SQN and I are trying to do a massive experiment to see if we can come up with something that pops--stay tuned.

**4) Use special blend to find the best looking girls in the area**

If I use my normal account then special account returns a bunch of fatties because I am not the hottest guy in the area. But if I use my girl account to search for girls in the area then I get to see a bunch of hotties.

**********************************

Your thoughts?

Oh also, guys will always answer stupid questions from a hot girl. ""How big is your dong?"" ""are you black?"" etc.


Lastly, moment of silence for KittensAndBoobs please. RIP.

**DISADVANTAGE**

If you troll people and brag about it they will hunt you down by ip and ban all accounts you signed in with from that ip address. I had to change my ip address recently and will stop telling people that i'm trolling them. if i just leave the conversation then they can't accuse me of shit.

9126,507,"Some people are wondering if it's unfair that ebooks are expensive or that books are not offered with a digital copy included. It doesn't have to do with fair or unfair. It has to do with making money. Publishing companies are not running charities, they are businesses. The more profit they can make, the better for them. When it becomes profitable to offer both formats for the same price then they will start doing this. 

I believe this will happen soon but only because more and more people will just pirate digital books and magazines. The only thing that would make a difference for people to actually buy instead of pirating is the hard copy of something. I would love to get the hard copy of a book if I buy the digital one. 

Also, let's not downplay the role that developing countries have. More and more people will start buying ""chinese"" kindles and will just pirate ebooks. US enforcement of copyrights only takes place in a number of countries and English becoming widely used all over the world makes this a huge issue for publishing companies that use traditional models. 

While the US might slow down ebook piracy through suits and so on in Europe and the US, it will continue to grow at a much faster pace all over the world. Nevertheless, ebook piracy is pretty different from movie and music piracy. Books are actually pretty neat and very nice to own. 

Music CDs, besides the booklet and art, offers piratically the same product as mp3 files. Some people might argue that they offer more since you don't have to carry around the CD. Movies are much better in digital format than in DVD. You don't have to watch 15 unskippable minutes of how bad it is to pirate or trailers of movies you don't care about, without mentioning that some people don't like trailers. But books are something amazing. Something that digital copies cannot provide yet. 

I'm not arguing that books are better than ebooks, I'm saying that both are different and they complement each other and I can't wait for the time when both are offered when you buy one. Hell, wouldn't it be amazing if you could donate the hard copy if you don't need it?

During this past weekend Tucson experienced a great tragedy. I would like to focus on one point that I believe is relevant.

The use of marijuana was brought up by many of the students who knew the suspect in this situation. I hope that the well-known connection between marijuana use and disorganized and confused thinking is not swept under the rug.

I recognize this state just passed a marijuana health law. But make no mistake - this is a dangerous drug, and time will tell if this was a wise decision.

9060,227,"So it appears that my ideas for the way nominations should happen aren't particularly popular.  I'm going to chalk this up partly to the fact that I didn't explain myself very well and mostly to the fact that I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.  One thing it *did* illuminate is that there are several talented, clever and motivated people who have better ideas than I do and I'm perfectly willing to facilitate them and subordinate (sublimate?) myself.

With that said, [slapchopsuey](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditoroftheweek/comments/f92i9/redditor_of_the_week_proposed_structure_and/c1e8zub) had an illuminating observation about nominations.  What I think his post demonstrates is a failure of scalability.  And while I take no issue with most of it, one aspect of it is in vital need of debate:

&gt;So the tl;dr of it is that early on, there won't be a need for a complex system. Though as the place grows, layers of complexity would be needed. With only one ROTW per week, the nominations are going to pile up very quickly compared to ROTD with five per week, so ROTW will need a better system relatively quicker than ROTD did.

My personal and professional opinion is that getting the structure right *from the get-go* is vital to the continued success of ROTWhatever.  The problem is that changing approaches is always discontinuous and always stressful and when you do it because you have no choice, you're doubling-down on stress and doubling-down on hassle.  The time to change approaches is *before* you need to do it; if you wait until you're in an emergency state, you're going to increase your pain for a long time before you decrease your stress.

*   *    *   

So here's the discussion I think this group *needs* to have: 

**HOW ARE NOMINATIONS GOING TO BE HANDLED?**

CSS can change on the fly.  Bling can change on the fly.  Questions can change on the fly.  But if there isn't a really good back-end that will mostly maintain itself, the whole thing is gonna crumble... and it's gonna crumble at the time of most stress.  

I think everybody should put their heads together to come up with a way that nominations can be handled, decided upon and pushed through the system with the absolute minimum amount of personal overhead.  Burnout on the internet is never slow, it always comes in the form of a sky-high pyre that erupts out of nowhere.  Anything you *think* you can handle, divide by two and try to aim for less than that.  The system used should be able to be explained to any volunteer in less than 100 words and handoff should require nothing more than ""tag, you're it.""  Anything involving lots of passwords, lots of files resident on somebody's laptop, lots of stuff buried in the Mod mailbox is nothing more than dragon's teeth waiting to erupt from the field.  

So.  Ideas?  Several things have been suggested; let's ignore every other issue and focus on the one that seems to be sucking down most of everybody's time and come up with a way that isn't going to sow the seeds of ROTWhatever's destruction (again).

I would go as far as to say that whatever method we can come up with, the ease of handling it should dictate how often a RedditorOfTheWhatever should be held.  If we come up with a process that is going to take 4 man-hours, and there are only two people who can easily give ROTWhatever two hours a week, then it should be RedditorOfTheSemiMonth.  If, on the other hand, a structure can be built where it only takes a volunteer ten minutes to get stuff set up and there are three volunteers willing to give ten minutes a day, you could do three redditors of the day (note I find this possibility unlikely).  

Let's see what sort of system we can come up with, and let's see how much time it takes to operate.  Then let's build around *that,* rather than the other way 'round.  This endeavor comes down to people, completely, and when you're using up your people to get it done you're shortening the lifespan of the entire project."

As I just said in [my last FR](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/f5t35/fr_3_first_sarging_solo_wow_its_hard/), I'm way better at online and dates than I am at club/bar game. 

**The online bit:**

So I first messaged this girl about six days ago – we've got a fair amount in common, so it wasn't difficult coming up with an interesting and personalized first message (beyond ""hey baby whatsup""). She's a good bit younger than me, smart, and though it's hard to tell from her pictures, seems pretty damn cute.

She writes back the same day, enthusiastically – just talking about the stuff I had brought up. But then (this is cute) she immediately follows it up with, ""Was that too dorky to write back so quickly? I probably should've played it cool."" Which was a perfect opportunity for a tease, so I tell her, Yes, it was totally dorky, and I'm going to play it cool and not respond for a day now.

That was just to make her sweat for a minute. Instead, I follow it up with a second message saying, ""No, just kidding :)"" with an actual response to her response. (**Sidenote:** Even though you shouldn't generally message twice, there are always exceptions, so use your noggin.) She seems to dig the tease, and over the course of the same day we message back and forth a few more times. 

By the way, I kind of hate smileys (and took shit for one in [this FR](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/f2o9l/fr_a_lesson_in_boldness_and_text_game/)), but I feel like they're important for text-based teases. Humor is really easy to misinterpret without them.

So the next day I'm like, this is cool, but enough of this online bullshit. I tell her I'm not really into messaging forever, and we should meet. She's like, sure! She's free Wednesday (yesterday), so I suggest she meets me at the subway station at 8, at which point I'll walk her to my new place – not quite as ballsy as it seems, I'm in the middle of moving to an interesting house, which we had talked a bit about online – and then head out to a pub.

**The date:**

Wednesday arrives, and she arrives at the subway stop at 8, looking cuter than some of her pictures. We meander towards my house through some of these winding-as-fuck Boston streets – way more romantic than what you guys in grid-based cities have to work with, lol – which she digs. I give her the tour of my new place, which she goes gaga over. It also builds a ton of social proof I think, because I have a bunch of housemates.

After a bit, we head to the bar. We sit at a table facing each other, which isn't ideal IMHO, but it works out pretty well – I still get some kino opportunities by asking to see this cool ring she had on, and for most of the time I'm telling her a bunch of slightly-crazy-but-still-DHV stories from my past, which she seems excited by.

As we leave, she suggests we take the subway together (since we're going in the same direction), and my plan was to talk her into coming over to my other place (the one I'm moving out of, and where my bed still is) during the ride. But I came really close to fucking it up, because I got so engrossed in conversation that I forgot my stop was coming up, so all of a sudden I look up, and we're at my stop. **Fuuuuuck,** I'm thinking. Literally in the space of 6-7 seconds, she says goodbye, I tell her she should come over; she says, ""Yeah... Oh, wait, do you mean right now!?"" And I'm like, Yeah, come on! She comes, protesting she can't stay long, and we barely make it off before the doors close. 

**The home stretch:**

We get to my house, and I'm still thinking, is she going to bail in 30 minutes to catch the last train home, or am I going to f-close? We have some tea, and sit on the futon talking, my arm around her shoulder, and the energy feels good. She's clearly nervous but excited about being at someone's house she barely just met, and I don't get a strong sense of resistance or fear. 

But it doesn't feel like she's super turned on yet, so I felt the need to get a little creative with the kino. Instead of just going for the kiss all-in, I wait until she's in the middle of a sentence, lean in, and say, ""Keep talking,"" and then kiss her, just for a second. 

She stops and says, ""I don't think you're actually interested in what I was talking about,"" and pulls me in to kiss more, but I pull back and repeat the first half of her sentence. So she finishes, and we keep talking, and after a few minutes I do it again. 

Eventually I go in for real, and it's pretty smooth sailing from then on. I still feel like I haven't given enough push/pull over the course of the evening, so as I'm taking off her shirt, I tease her that it looks like an old lady's (it does), and she seems to enjoy it. 

At some point I pull her up to standing and say, ""Let's go to my room, it's more comfortable,"" and she comes – I think I'm leading her by the wrist – but still displaying this mixture of nervousness and excitement.** ""I can't believe I met you four hours ago and I'm going to your room!""** she said. And then: ""OK, if I'm in your bed I have to know your last name.""

After a rousing game of hide-the-salami, she asks what time it is – of course it's well beyond the last train time. I don't feel like making her take an expensive cab ride home, so she crashes, and we cuddle.

From my thinking, this would produce a solid generation of failures, followed by a new generation of very smart, outgoing children. It would take the generation of failures for people to see what happens, and for the new one to learn.

EDIT: Not that the new generation of children would somehow know that they should go so school, but more that the failed generation, who have had the kids, would see the benefit of the education, and somehow encourage their kids to attend in a manner which we don't see today.

*A wake is a ceremony associated with death. Traditionally, a wake takes place in the house of the deceased, with the body present; however, modern wakes are often performed at a funeral home.*

The day after the season ends, everyone should go to the stadium, onto the field and drink, sing songs, etc with the players. Celebrate the...well, whatever life you had.

It could be really cathartic. Why should the winner be the only one with a party? Their Superbowl parades...screw them! Have your own shindig at the stadium. It would be good for you to laugh and have a little fun.

Normally, I'm a huge smartass. And coming from a Steeler fan, you'd be right to question my motivations. But also remember as a Steeler fan, *we don't hate you*. We can't bring ourselves to hating a man who's down and truly humbled by their circumstances.

Make this happen, Bengals fan. Call it **""Bengalwake 2011""**, yes I know we haven't gotten through 2010-2011, but come on...let's just be realistic.

You can rent the stadium from the city. What would Mike Brown have to say about it? Jack shit. Get some sponsors, maybe Skyline could sell some awesome chili or something. Who knows? It would send a powerful message to Brown, especially if you booked it right now."

3691,83,"Hey guys,

I proposed to her when we were both still in school, but given our financial situation, we've been engaged for a while now (2 years and counting) and given the fact that only I'm working and both of us have large student debt (i'm almost done, need 1 more year) and she intends on going away to grad school.

We can't stay engaged forever (according to her of course) and we want to have a decent and proper wedding that she'll be proud to post on facebook (lol, okay i'll be serious now) and something where we can have it be memorable, a dream wedding, but be affordable as well. I want to be able to start actually physically planning this thing, but I have no idea where to start other than complainig about a budget that we don't have (i'm assuming $30,000 or so) and trying to allocate a budget on things I know nothing of.

Redditors, where do I start? Seriously, what should the first few things I need to do be? We've got a tentative date next APRIL, so that part is done. What next? I'm currently 23, will be 25 in April 2012, she'll be 24. I'll be low on the totem pole in a corporate job, she'll still be in grad school.

Things I'm good at:
- Organizing things in excel, onenote, outlook
- budgeting

What should I do? I really only care about having a place to go back to (our own home/condo for example) instead of a very expensive party, but that's where the fighting starts and that's how we get nothign done when trying to plan the wedding together. What should I do to get started?

Sorry for the mixed-up post, but if you guys have suggestions, that'd be great.

**TL;DR we got engaged, but for financial reasons we couldn't have the traditional wedding right away. We argue about money, but want to have a respectable wedding AND a place to live on student/new grad budgets. Guy here, doesn't know where to start when it comes to ""planning a wedding.""**

**EDIT:** Thanks for all for all of the advice guys/gals. I love all of the ideas, we're thinking sometime in April, so the weather may be a bit of an unknown factor and outdoor stuff will be hard to predict as it could be rainy, cold, or cloudy which may put a damper on the whole thing. Um, to save money, the ceremony will just be for close friends and family in a small chapel. The photos will look brilliant taken there in my opinion, a few of them black and white a bunch of them with the classic, rustic scenery in the background.

Reception: 

- open bar - an absolute must, we will invest in the good stuff here, but use SPARKLING WINE ($10/bottle) for the toasts and everything and use customized labels we designed outselves

- we have friends who can DJ/play live music

- uncle and a friend are in photography

- dad has connections for a limo

- mother and friends can do the flowers for us

- cake looks like it'll be taken care of by a friend who can help us assemble a bunch of cakes into one big wedding cake. We also talked about using fake layers at the bottom and having the real cake at the top or middle.
- it's slowly comign together: now to find the ""perfect"" venue which is small, but looks large/nice and quaint. That'll be a challenge but we'll try and manage.

**EDIT 2:** also, i've been hitting the gym hard, and lawyering up (heh, getting all of the legal stuff so we can get our own place) and i'm going to make sure we get our teeth whitened so the pictures and or video look better."

It's my friend's first time smoking. He did a bit of self-diagnosis for medical use and has been wary about trees for awhile but I convinced him to at least give it a shot if he was feeling up to it. He even made a post on /trees/ asking certain questions a month or so ago for more information. 

So... Right then. Let's start the documentation, shall we? He shall be smoking out of an MFLB with normal stuff from IL. Not too bad, not too good. Not too crystally, some trichromes, but not shit. =D 

* **7:10 PM - 2 hits from MFLB after a quick ""how to""**

* 7:30 PM - No ""real effect"" yet claimed from him, but he was giggling at a Dead Space Youtube video pretty much... I suspect [.5/1].

* **7:36 PM - Took another MFLB hit after I showed him it doesn't need to be leaking vapor prior to the hits. He's been dragging a bit slow and burning it and coughing. Trying to fix. Regardless... ""It tastes like burnt popcorn""**

* **7:50 PM - One more MFLB hit. I think he's slowly getting the hang of how to use it. No discernible effect yet, but he's been taking small hits so far, as well as trying to get the handle on it. **

* 8:10 PM - ""'Bravado'.... I could see that being a drink at Starbucks....""

* **8:15 PM - Another MFLB hit after a quick battery charge... he fucked up and overheated it / pulled too slow, so he chokes because he hit a bit too hard. Oh well. Water for him now while I load my bong =D**

* **8:30 PM - One and a half more hits. MFLB batteries need another charge. Last hit was a bit strong. Probably will reload bowl in a sec. Orange juice, ahoyyyyy.**

* 8:50 PM - Relaxing while batteries for MFLB charge. Watching Youtube videos. Snuggling up together. D'awwww &lt;3

* **8:58 PM - Playing Rock Band 3, he picks Du Hast on Pro Keys, notices he plays one key the whole song, bursts out laughing, falls on bed, still laughing. It's hilarious. **

* Friend Edit: I told him I didn't want to play rockband because I'd wind up hitting one key over and over. What happened? I picked Du Hast and wound up playing the same key the majority of the song.

* **9:35 PM - Just finished half of a new MFLB bowl. OJ break =D! Maybe some gaming too. He wants WoW. No moar Rock Band 3 D= Oh well. **

* 9:46 PM - Searching Netflix for movies. Eh... Nah, no Heavy Metal right now... *Browse...* ""Who's George Carlin?"" That's it, we're watching Georgie. Smoking a bit of the MFLB too.


* **UPDATE: We fell asleep cuddling naked and such =D Was early, I was exhausted. Maybe more smoke tonight.**

8165,177,"Often I see posts on r/Sydney where people are moving here and want to know about renting i.e. where to live, how much to pay, etc. 

When I first moved out of home, I was 18 and made a lot of mistakes. If I'd been better prepared I could have saved a lot of money, relationships and irritation. I thought we could band together and write about our experiences and what we've learned, potentially creating a good resource for the sidebar.

When I started writing my bit to start off the conversation, I got well and truly carried away. I had a lot to say, most of it experiential and personal. So I started writing in a google doc. A few hours later, I got to the point where I wanted to recruit other experienced Sydney redditor renters to start adding their sections.

[I've made an editable google doc](https://docs1.google.com/document/d/1PVsXKUTJyxtq8p0yHfCu1cPEDqqkp6VB1uTW7OZrVVA/edit?authkey=CKiXl8MN&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1#) but I also have a personal copy which I'll add bits to as I see them written in case we get a troll in there.

When it's done, we can post it to the sidebar and maybe get a less constant stream of 'renting advice' posts giving the same advice.

I'll probably keep adding stuff when I get motivation, but until then - edit away! Any questions, let me know here - but otherwise, don't be shy about making any changes yourself.

Only two rules:

1. Don't delete anything someone else has written (I'll keep an eye out for obvious trolls), even if you don't agree with it. If you have another perspective, write a section about it.

2. Write a blurb about yourself and your renting experience in 'About the Authors', then credit yourself in what you've written. This will give people reading the opportunity to read things by people with similar needs to them. A lot of this stuff is subjective, so this should be a good way to make a good resource. Even if you don't want to identify yourself, or use your reddit username, put some kind of identifier in.

Sure i have my gripes, sure things could be run better, sure i might not have elected the people in power.
Sure there are problems in society, sure decisions get made that the powers that be don't consult me directly on.

recklessly speeding or driving drunk, or under the influence of drugs, then good, all of that will help me live my life the way i want it. 

To all of those who say true freedom is some form of anarchy, i feel sorry for you. 

Should lawlessness ever prevail, that is not a world i want to live in, for it would surely shorten my lifespan. 

Anarchy is not freedom, anarchy is the ability to do whatever you want at the detriment of others. 

I am free, do not tell me other wise.

1151,489,"I don't want to make this long-winded and end up having everyone say TL;DR, but I want to get this point across. 

As a gay male in high school, I've experienced a lot of abuse both verbal and physical for my sexuality. Sometimes it comes from people I barely know, but it also can come from friends and even family. All I want to say is the reason it was so hard for me to originally come out was because I thought everyone was going to react negatively. Everyone said gay-this and gay-that for anything unpleasant, people who some people didn't like were called ""faggots"" or ""queers"", and many of even my closest friends would make fun of people for anything slightly effeminate they did by calling them ""cocksuckers"" or ""fagboys"" or whatever else. 

After coming out, I realized many of these people simply used the words because they were part of the dialect they were brought up around. The thing is, these words were harmful, and they tortured me quite awhile. Before I came out, when I heard the word faggot I'd flash to images of myself having to come out and how everyone would hate me. I'd feel insecure, and end up completely emotionally distraught. I know many people say ""word's meanings change"" or that ""I didn't actually mean homosexuals by it"", but the thing is for a scared kid who hasn't come out yet, it's enough to drive you to a deep depression. 

My plea to you Reddit is to try to use a different word in place of the homophobic slurs. Simply calling things what they are. Your job isn't ""gay"", it's boring. Your coworker isn't a ""fag"", he's annoying to you. 

I want to make this explicitly clear: I don't mean this message to be an attack, because I understand many people mean no harm whatsoever by these words, I simply want to inform the general Reddit population that the words can hurt, and even drive LGBT teens afraid to come out to a deep depression. Being conscientious about the words you choose, and even speaking out and informing others the effect these words can have can make such a huge difference for those LGBT teens who are too afraid to come out, or insecure about who they are.

This ended up being longer than I wanted it to be, so I'm sorry for the rant, but I want to thank you for taking the time to read this.

3640,146,"When I was little My dad had two computers in his office. one for him and one for mom. We referred to them as the work computer and play computer despite the fact mom would use hers for work anyway. This was back when you could load windows from DOS. At the age of four I had a head start for reading, writing and typing because of this. I got to play games like Tom and Jerry Cat Astrophe, Cosmo's cosmic adventure. and a lot of other cool games. I even remember waling in on my mom and dad playing tetris together, back when you could split scree games on the same computer and share a keyboard (man I feel old). 

   However eventually my Brother and I heard of the game greats mario, link, sonic, etc and wanted so badly to get a console of our own. our dad didnt want to because of his PC. and to be fair he was right, he upgraded his pc enough at the time for ""Cutting Edge"" 3d support since he was a cad designer, so we got to play fairly state of the art PC games still though they were mostly unknown titles. However one day a yellow rodent by the name of pikachu came along and I wanted a gameboy more than ever. Dad finally caved in because he saw the merit to portable gaming and laptops were crap back then and would rather pay $100 for a gameboy color than shell out $1000 for something we didn't really want. Of course my brother and I played pokemon to the point of mastery. Caught all 150 learned the missingno glitch, as well as the level 100+ pokemon multiplayer exploit, being the school kids mewtwo with ease.

   But of course my brother longed to still own a console, but once again our dad wouldnt let us because PC did more. despite the fact my brother had the money to buy an N64, three more controllers and goldeneye. Nevertheless dad said we shouldn't so my brother with the help of very little of my money saved up some more for a PC to play games on. It was a Windows 98 machine and if I remember right It played DVDs too so it was pretty good. ~~We~~ My brother was playing games like Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, and Homeworld. However the problem was we were running an average household computer for more advanced games on Windows 98. We would get every problem in the book and had no Idea what to do other than ctrl+alt+del. we could care less about what else pc had to offer, and wanted to play games only. 

   So in 2002 Microsoft Launches the XBOX. We got it with our Dad's blessing, partially because it was Microsoft, and mostly we were getting older and he was getting tired of saying no to consoles. of course we had a ball. our next door neighbor got the xbox and we would come over to each others houses and play multiplayer. So at this point and time I had pretty much abandoned PC for gaming. only to use internet.

When the xbox was replaced by the 360. we had over 40 games on our shelf. We traded a lot of games, but kept the ones we liked. we got our 360, FINALLY got Xbox live, enjoyed the extra goodies, and all the while I was getting MUCH better with PCs only with one major problem. I was using a dinosaur of a computer. Mind you I wasnt ""gaming"" on PCs I was a heavy flash user making trips to newgrounds hoping one day to make my own animations. problem was I had no money for that sort of thing. 

So in the meantime I stuck to school computers learning how to get past blocks with ease. I learned photoshop in school so I at one point nailed a job at a photography studio and was able to get a beast of a pc to work at home. Now just for giggles I tried PC gaming. I got steam, played portal and what a difference! I played it on our 360 but PC offered MUCH more! I had a dev console, I got free downloads for levels, and mods. I could use ventrillo instead of hearing a nine year old pretending to be mature by swearing in the mic at a ridiculous volume. 

I could get games for dirt cheap on steam. I had the money and know how for upgrades. The console gamers squabbles become more irrelevant to me as third parties became more of a norm and the only console exclusives were not nearly as impacting as sonic, mario, and the rest. I could play ROMs and ROM hacks of classic games from all consoles past. I could even run a sever of my own. 

Thank You PC. Sorry I Neglected You. I guess I had to grow up.

5722,711,"Looks like we wont be getting Hmod or Bukkit (the 2 main mod programs) running anytime soon.  This is taken directly from bukkit's front page:

&gt;Although people have already been under the impression that we pledged to keep hMod up to date, this isn't the case. Prior to this announcement, we had not stated anywhere that we would be &gt;maintaining hMod and anyone believing otherwise was mistaken. However, we do recognise the predicament we've put server admins in as hey0 has announced that hMod is essentially no more, and Bukkit is not ready for public consumption yet.
&gt;
&gt;As such, some of us - if not the entire team - will be trying to update hMod so that you guys aren't left in the dark without a server mod to use. We never intended to shut everyone out with our early announcement - we were just looking to drum up support from plugin authors so that we had things ready. We can honestly say that we did not anticipate the project blowing up with this much activity and interest this quickly, like it did.
&gt;
&gt;Once again:
&gt;We will try and update hMod (at least this time), but we offer ABSOLUTELY NO promises that we'll be able to do it as a lot has changed and we are no longer as familiar with the project as we once were.
&gt;
&gt;UPDATE:
&gt;We've tried fixing hMod but had little to no luck. It's way too messy to work on and too much has changed in the last few Minecraft updates.

10201,495,"Hey guys,

[Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fbgun/fr_la_seddit_club_meetup_and_kclose/) a writeup from Cakebread's perspective. Same event, but Cake focuses more on his sarge before we meet and I after.

**Background**
IncognitoL and I met up with few of our friends to attend the USC/UCLA/Cal Tech Grad student bar last night. On site, we met up with cptncrnch whom we've met before. We also got to know Cakebread who called me on the night of.

While waiting for Cake to find me I get shitted on:  a HBx comes up, grabs my hair:

""is that a toupé or something?"" 

(caught off guard) No...it's my real hair

(As they walk away) Oh that's cool. I like it.

As she walks away I realized her hair was a pile of badly straightened horseshit and I should just have made that clear to her. Or not even recognize. Even though I've read the shit-test lists, I think the safe approach is not acknowledging or even just ignoring after a brief reply: You're (fucking) rude. 

**Partner-up**
Cakebread and I jumped into action right away. We took turns opening. I'll let Cake score the girls from 1-10:

*Set 1*

Me: 3-set
We talked for a significant amount of time. I just opened with a ""Hi, I'm new here; are you guys having fun?"" and went from there. All of them are very friendly, a blond girl engages me in particular, and the dark haired girl and the indian girl are more subtle. Cakebread worked on the two.

Conversation goes something like:

*after Introductions etc*

Blond: Does anyone ever call you Ross?

Me: Does anyone ever call you Monica ((fucking couldn't remember Jennifer Anninston's character name) Rachel? Who the fuck makes Friends reference out of the blue -. -;)?

Blabblabhblah; the blond is sorta dancing and playing around next to me

Me: You look like you've got some moves. Why aren't you dancing?

Blond: Oh I don't know; I just want to meet some guys. But the only guy whom I've met so far is totally not into me

Should've said something here but took me a second too long to think of an appropriate line


After a bit more talk the blond girl wanted to facebook me. I tell her it's a bad idea, just give me your number. But since I had already given her my full name (as was suggested in seddit before), she insisted until she actually did find me. Which is fine because I have no information whatsoever (even friends can't view anything). I'm not going to friend her though. We talk for about a good 15 minutes until I feel we've spent too much time with one set. I go over to Cakebread and say, ""hey we've really gotta get back to our friends."" Cakebread acknowledges and we do a clean pull out. No closes which was fine for me b/c I wasn't interested. But Cakebread did mention that he found one of the girls cute, and unfortunately the 3rd girl was getting in the way. Note to self, make sure to 1) find a way to communicate interest 2) help the seducer isolate.  

*Set 2*

Cake: 1-brief ""set""
I'll let Cake tell this but basically he gave a (what I consider as a) huge neg to a decent girl. It didn't work out, but he's got balls to do this cold turkey.

*Set 3*

Me: 4-set
Cake and I hit the dance floor to see how it is. I see a group of 4 asian girls so I spring into action. I get behind a girl and ask her, you girls are having fun; mind if I join you? And start dancing with her. She looks back and turns around w/o resistance which I take as a go. After some kino, I make Cake take the girl as I move on to a friend of hers. Unfortunately though, she turns around and says something shaking her head so I move on and Cake pulled out as well (iirc). 

*Set 4*

Cake: 2-set
Cake opens two blond girls. He takes one and I join him for the other. I begin with an epic fail when I gave a light kiss to her hand which didn't work. I had to tease her a lot to re-establish. She tells me I look too young, so I make her guess my age (which she couldn't for her life). She ends up telling me, well, we'll have to dance. I say alright let's go. Unfortunately Cake's girl ends up bailing. We recap and move on.

*Set 5*

Me: 2-set
I open two asian girls who turned out to be attending UCLA. I talked to them briefly, about why they're just standing around instead of dancing. I try to get them to the floor, but one of them tells me it's too crowded. I continue the conversation for a bit. But I get a text and after analyzing the situation it wouldn't be worth the effort (which, looking back, might've been a bad decision since I don't really care about the quality right now as much as quantity to expand my experiences).

*Set 6*

Cake: 3-set
Cake mostly worked on this. I just jumped in late to talk briefly. 3-set of 2 girls and 1 guy who had actually just met each other. 

**Departure**

After this Cake had to take off. So I joined my group of friends. Nothing too much came of it afterwards other than running into couple of familiar faces and hitting the floor with the group. 


**Notes**

Positive notes:
	1. Opened few sets for the first time in life
	2. Didn't chicken out at first bar experience
	3. Had mild to moderate success with couple girls
	4. Got some action/kino on the dance floor

Things to work on:
	1. Talking to EVERYONE (esp guys)
	2. Having an interesting and engaging conversation
	3. Coming up with an appropriate response to shit tests or when good opportunities come up
	4. Negging
	5. Kino 
	6. Smoothly initiating dance
	7. Using friends/group 
	8. Approaching girls WHILE maintaining a superior inner game (I feel that just by approaching I'm at a disadvantage since it implies I'm interested)
	9. I went as a group but was sarging with Cake most of the time. But I feel now instead of concentrating the entire night sarging with sedditors I should've just hung out with the group to have fun with my friends.
	

**Summary**


Overall, I had a good time. The night could've been better, but it definitely could've been worse. At the end of the day, it just matters that I talked to some new people, caught up with some old friends, and engaged in a new experience. IncognitoL and I were glad to see cptncrnch again (looking baller in his suit) and meet Cakebread. Even though this was the first time I've met him, I could already tell he's got some balls and we have some great fun coming our way. I'm looking forward to the next night out!

If you're so concerned about speed to the front lines, bring a steak sandvich with you as well.

It's already been said in the GRU strat comments that the Fists are better for retreat due to the damage lessened while running away, but did you know the following?:

* Fists + Medic means you can very effectively taunt a sentry and have your team come in with you to kill it. I feel like I'm the only person who effectively does this (and it usually takes the medics some convincing to heal you instead of someone else for a few moments, even though you're ""worthless"" by ""sitting there with your melee weapon out doing nothing."" Seriously, so many times have I done this and we've effectively taken out a level 3 sentry repeatedly without uber built yet. TRY IT SOMETIME.

* Try using the fists at periods of high damage if you have a healer, when pushing with your team. Again, you're usually a high priority target, so just being there taking little damage while your team sweeps in is an effective strategy rather than you with your minigun out soaking too much damage and dying.

Post more strats and tips / etc in comments, I'm about to go out for food with a friend.

6127,53,"Invented offsite but turned into a community here, rage comics were the
original ""anyone can make a comic"" template that has spawned so many
variants (including one of our other Best of 2010 winners).

Thanks to the hard work of [/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu](/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu)
(that's seven F's and twelve U's), you can now share other redditors' joys
and frustrations without having to resort to reading boring old *words.*
They also popularized a CSS hack that allows images to be inserted into
comments, along with secret mouseover text.

Oh, you didn't know about the mouseovers? Time to reread two and a half
years worth of comment pages. (At least you can make a comic about it.)

Congratulations to /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu, to [the other finalists](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2010/comments/f0zjw/final_round_best_big_community/), and to [everyone else who was nominated](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2010/comments/ewf6u/nominate_best_big_community/)."

2264,3,"When you look at a lot of open source projects, they are created by software developers that want to create a particular tool.  Maybe they are backed by the company they are work for or not.  Also, companies may start an open project or convert a commercial product to a open source one.

But rarely, do you see the United States federal government push out a popular open source tool.

I know that Obama wanted to invest in science and technology. He seems to have fired a smart CTO.  I wish there was more a focus on computer science and software and not necessarily the general sciences.  The CDC, NHS have important programs that receive federal government.  At the same time, they spend a lot resources to contract out software and information technology work.  "
7516,27,"Last spring, I was sitting in the park near my dorm with some fellow potheads and enjoying the sunshine. Lo and behold, two strangers approach us, who have hash oil and no paraphernalia from which to taste its sweet, sweet nectar. Being the generous and greedy (those can simultaneously exist) stoners we are, we invite them to hit our bowls, as long as they reload it with the golden, gooey, icky sticky.

We settle down again after the initial round of introductions and pass the pipes around and just start shooting the breeze. The Most Amazing Individual, Cap, was like no one I've ever met before. With strangers, we generally present the image we've crafted over the years. This guy had no falsehood, no pretense, none of that bullshit. When he spoke, you could hear his soul. No small talk, no meaningless trivialities. Real fucking communication without any of the smokescreens we throw up.

Cap's from Humboldt. He farms marijuana for a living. He met his wife at Mardi Gras. Him from Marijuana Mecca and her from Tennessee. Love at first sight. He says he just knew and that was it. Few months later, she moves to California, they get married, have 3 kids, and have been living happily ever after for the past 8 years. True fucking love, right? I've never heard someone actually give a fairy tale as the story of how they met their significant other.

I spoke to him of how much I hated certain things about people. And he answered thusly: Science has been able to explain so many ""what's"" and ""how's"", and will continue to do so. But they'll never be able to answer ""Why?"" Why are we here. We know how the heart beats, how the lungs breathe in air, but we can never know why it is that our heart so resolutely beats on. We live as long as we are to live, until the Great Spirit calls us back home. All of existence, it remains living because it is deemed worthy still. And no one is able to question or somehow undermine the value of their existence. There is no place for hate. Hate is based upon an illusion that we are separate and different in an essential way. This parallels another one of my favorite old-timey fables. Segue!

The little wave said to the big wave, ""You are so big, while I am so little and insignificant.""  
""No, your eyes deceive you. We are but temporary manifestations of the same nature.""  
""I understand now. I am you. You are me. We are one.""

Meanwhile, back in the park...
He asked me why I studied English. Because I'm fascinated with ideas, everyone's ideas. He answers that all true learning is shared, passed from one to another. That we've forgotten the humility it takes to ask for teaching and then receive it. That if we knew how to ask, the very spirits (like I said, he intro'd me to that New Age book) will heed our call. Knock, and the door will be opened and all that. He shares a particular experience with drugs + meditation that relates to my quest for knowledge. 

He came upon the spirits and they asked, ""What is it that you wish to know?""  
""Everything. I want to know everything.""  
And two came right by his ears and an incomprehensible stream of all there is to know flooded his mind. He was overwhelmed by the agony of his mind about to implode onto itself for having sought too much. He said it took over a year before he could muster up the courage to approach the spirits again.  
""What is it that you wish to know?""  
""The truth.""  
And he claims that life has made sense ever since then.

Cap spoke in poetics, he spoke with a self-assuredness that comes only to those long-versed in speaking truth and never falsehood. He spoke with the full confidence of his soul's worth and the worthlessness of all the bullshit pretenses people put up. He lived the life he wished to live. He spoke of love, unity, all that his life was and that everyone else's could be. Not if they did what he did, but if they just sought out those things for themselves. Seek, and ye shall motherfucking find.

Postscript: This was prior to my plunging into psych's, and his wisdom did a lot to prepare me for the journeys I've undertaken. We spent pretty much the whole day together, even when his and my friends disbanded and wandered off. I really wish we hadn't gotten so high so I could remember more details of our conversation, but I was very deeply moved by our time together.

TL;DR: I had an amazing afternoon talking to a weed farmer from Humboldt back when I was a freshman in college."
1435,701,"Yes, I'm aware my title has lots of CAPS while I'm complaining about something being lame. Before you leave your witty comment, move on.

Is anyone else totally fucking pissed about how loud the commercials are on XM/Sirius? It's been like this ever since I got my subscription back in 2005. Is there any type of petition going around that might help make the difference? Is there a phone number that can get me connected to some type of customer care agent that isn't located in India? Honestly, I love talk radio on Sirius/XM, and I'm not likely to cancel because of this, but I want them to chill with the loud ass commercials.

The dock for my iPhone (the device I use to stream the service) has to be turned up all the way to hear the programming, but let the commercials start and that mother fucker rocks!"

2713,720,"Right, so. I've been dating this absolutely amazing girl for close to three months now- long distance but we met. Everything was fantastic up until her parents decided that they didn't want us to see each other (we're both legal), and now she won't respond to emails.

I've given her until the end of the month to say something before I make myself move on, but I really don't think she cares enough to do so anymore and am scrambling to come up with backup plans if she doesn't. 

Right, so. 2008 or so and I met my Russian tutor, Mari, through my boss. The language barrier is too great to actually get any learning done, so we end up becoming friends instead. Fast-forward a year and she and four other friends are living with me in this weird Bohemian arrangement. We kept trying to start a relationship, but another friend was keeping it apart for reasons that didn't manifest until a year later (when she did the exact same thing again). 

Now Mari is a great girl. Very cute, fun to be around, frightfully brilliant, and worldly as. We both want to do roughly the same thing with our lives, and at one point we were actually considering getting a marriage of convenience so she could have my citizenship and the much better passport that comes with it. 

I talked with her earlier today and asked if she wanted to do something crazy with me in a few months. She sounded genuinely enthusiastic, and I went on to explain that I wanted to get out of the west and spend 2011 backpacking Ukraine/Romania with her. Instantly she jumps at the opportunity, and I'm positive that it will lead to the relationship we never had. However, I kept the invitation open because I don't want to lead her on if the first girl comes through in the end. 

I love the first girl more than anything. Same sense of humour (extremely rare because I'm demented as hell), same taste in movies, same libido, same yearning to conquer the world. We talk for hours about absolutely everything and only stop when we realise that the sun came up two hours prior and we're too tired to type. She's stunningly beautiful, hilarious, creative, studious, compassionate, and I hear cellos when I'm around her. Hell, even holding her hand in the back of a minivan was more fantastic than drunken nights in Prague. 

If I go down that path with Mari, I'd be destroying all means of contact with the first girl. This ignoring thing strikes me as so cowardly and low that I just won't be treated that way. I'll trade one citizenship for Australian or Kiwi, then be double-commonwealth and build a bomb-proof hobbit hovel out in the forest as a base of sinister responsibility avoidance and general mischief while spiriting around the globe studying anthropology and doing copious amounts of petty crime.  

If I wait for the first girl, there's a very good chance she won't come around. I don't want to throw away the best years of my life chasing ghosts, much less ghosts who choose to be as such, and this whole ordeal is just sickening. However, I'm a helpless romantic and see [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cmavp/what_small_decision_did_you_make_that_altered_the/c0tm6ce?context=2) as being a very accurate picture of the future I'd make with her. 

If I stop waiting for first girl and go with Mari, I feel like I'd be using her to get over first girl and I respect her too much to do that. It seems selfish and twattish. 

Where the hell am I going with this? I'm not even sure anymore. Is a girl who personifies everything you love in a person, who makes you feel like god as you're stuck in a Detroit bus station fighting with a homeless guy for control over your shitty laptop and fantasising about being able to afford fast food, and who wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire worth waiting for? Is it a terrible, if fun as, decision to jump headfirst into things with friends you've not spoken to in months? Do Russian girls really chop your cock off if you look at them the wrong way? Do eunuchs live fulfilling lives?

8981,40,"So everyone knows the prices are as follows:

$5000/ month for 600 S (next to the temple)
$3700/ month for I-15

They have a special on a rotary digital board (where it goes through 4 different locations throughout the year) 12 months for $3700

They also have boards that move through a list of locations to create ""Brand recognition""; for $3750 a month.

Those are the price points.  Now for some fundraising:

Any and all interested in helping with this project; we'll build a list of contacts

I would suggest we approach this as follows:
1) set up the site.  Get the domain registered and on a host.  Someone with web skills can do this immediately.  

2)  We get the messages planned for the next several months.  A theme and a focus for a paid keyword campaign for each month.

3) Fundraising.  We need to reach out on the postmormon sort of websites.  I think also reaching into the gay community for donations on a rebuttal to prop 8... a ""Get to know your own religion before you attack us"" style of communication would get them willing to donate.

4) We set a projected target... something like 600 South for 2 months ($10,000) and a rotary board for 6 months ($7,500)  $2000 for website development and paid keyword campaigns, means we need $20,000

5)  We put up a thermometer/ donation scale to show how close we are

6)  We go nuts getting other atheism activist groups/etc. willing to put forward cash.

7)  We put up the first billboard; and contact the media.  Get buzz going in both directions and more donations will roll in for later ones

Yes, I know $20k sounds like a ton of money.  Let's set the sites for $500 for website and paid keyword right now; and worry about $5000 for a billboard after those are built.

Any thoughts, suggestions?"
6657,592,"I got a 250gb hard drive that I know will work (due to research) from my brother (Yayyy Frankie) and am looking for anyone who has done this before.  I know this will throw my warranty straight into the dump truck, but does anyone have any tips or has anyone done this before?"
4634,161,"**EDIT:** Should warn you all that a wall of text is ahead...

I'm posting this because I think it was crazy and I'm naturally awful at FFA. I've only ever played FFA once before in Black Ops as well.

I start looking for a game and it quickly dumps me into a Nuketown game in progress. Lovely. When it loads I take my Commando Hardline/Sleight of Hand/Hacker class (all pro perks - I should have set up a nice quiet class for FFA, but since it's Nuketown it probably wouldn't have mattered).

Quickly looking at the scoreboard, the game's a few minutes in and the two leaders are tied at 8 kills, with close followers. I'm at the bottom. Knowing I'd have a battle against me, I decide to rack up as many kills as I can.

I spawn in the middle (terrible) but get one kill right off the bat as someone dashes between houses. Someone spawns beside me and shoots his silenced weapon, giving him away, and I make short work of him with my trusty knife. Before I finish my follow through, I get shot by a passer by.

I spawn behind a house and start forward, checking my surroundings for any fellow spawners. Satisfied, I charge into the garage of the house, and immediately get knifed from behind by someone using Ninja Pro.

At this point I give up with the Commando and join in on the AK74u rage with my own class, sporting Lightweight/SoH/Marathon (all pro).

I spawn in the same location and run alongside the garage, looking to pick off anyone crossing the middle. Hearing gunshots from the other house I run forward and pick off someone with their back to me. During a reload, I'm once again knifed. The leader is now at 11 kills.

I spawn behind the same house and shoot someone charging out of the house into the backyard. Another enters from the front and he is also eliminated. My goal now is to secure this house. Reloading, I check the side of the house and find no one.  A spy plane is called and I am found and knifed. :&gt;

I spawn at the opposite end, but my goal remains the same. I enter the house to find it empty, and return to the backyard to find an enemy running up the deck stairs. Without bothering to bring my sights up, he is shot and eliminated. Climbing the stairs, I find someone hiding in the second floor of the house, and I am killed.

I spawn at the opposite end and immediately shoot at an enemy on the second floor deck, but he runs inside and evades some of my fire. I charge after him and find him with his back to me, and upon seeing me he charges into the stairwell, once again evading fire. He drops a claymore as I come around and knife me, and we kill each other. :(

The leader is at 14 kills. I am at 7.

Spawning once again at the opposite house I immediately open fire on someone using a Ballistic Knife in the backyard, and kill him. I race through the garage into the house, and take fire from the backyard. I walk up the stairs to take cover and he foolishly comes to finish me off - but I shoot and drop him first as I return back down the stairs. An enemy follows him but I have to reload - I start back upstairs, reload, and shoot his follower dead. Reloading, I find someone in Second Chance upstairs, and I knife him as he tries to shoot me, all his shots missing. Wheeling around I spot another coming up the deck stairs from outside, and taking a few his he dies to my AK74u. I take even more fire from the backyard, and knowing that was a losing battle, I retreat inside and down the stairs to the first floor. I unload a few rounds into an enemy hiding behind the fence in the backyard but he eludes my killing rounds and I am forced to swap weapons for a Galil. Sweeping the house for enemies I get flanked and shot down, only one away from a Napalm Strike.

The leader is at 17 kills. I am at 11.

Teens - more of the Batman, Clone Wars cartoon styles.

Adults - full blown Marvel, Image, DC, and Dark Horse comics.  True comic comics.

878,467,"I submitted this last night during the outage and don't know if anyone saw it, so I'm trying again. I think it's pretty interesting.

In Raiders, he's rescued because he has a plane waiting in the river, near the temple. What was that plane doing there, just over the hill from the Hovito temple? We know Jones didn't fly there since (A) we see him and his companions trekking through the jungle a lot farther than the distance from the plane, and (B) the plane only had room for Jones and the pilot. So that means Jones had to know the location of the temple in advance and told the pilot where to meet him, and that he had no intention of taking his companions along after he got the idol. The obvious conclusion to draw is that he knew in advance that the area was filled with booby traps and wanted companions along to use as catspaws to trigger them. If any of his men survived the temple, they'd be left for a Hovito stewpot.

In light of these facts, we must also reconsider the actions of Alfred Molina's character, Satipo, who betrayed Jones in the temple. To a viewer who accepts Spielberg's manipulative telling of the story, Satipo is a rat bastard who betrayed Jones. But obviously he twigged to Jones' plan and decided to beat him to the punch.

Thankfully there was a reputable archaeologist on the scene, who, though he failed to save poor Satipo, stopped Jones from stealing the Hopito's rightful property and heritage. If Belloq hadn't been foolish enough to take a Nazi grant for his expedition, he'd be the hero of the movie. As it is, the only thing Jones has going for him is that he hates Nazis, which isn't a particularly high bar.

I never even considered this until I read this little blog (which also has awesome pictures of both Kristen Bell and Melissa Joan Hart in slave Leia costumes).

EDIT: Revelation. After I thought of one unit squared, we can think of a ""unit squared"" as a completely different unit. When we have two units by two units, you multiply to get the entire square of ""unit squared"" chunks; in that sense, multiplication is a natural way to go about it.

This [animation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tachyon04s.gif) helps my explanation a little. The animation shows the tachyon splitting into the part going forward in time and the part going backward in time. If this occurs at every instant of the tachyons being, there would be an infinite number of these animations strung together, thereby forming a solid line. 

Is this assumption right?

It is illegal to have sex with a minor even if it is consensual. The reason is, our society has determined that a minor does not have the maturity/capacity to make the right decision and is subject to be easily influenced. 

This is the exact same with advertising. 

Therefore... 100% of ads targeting minors should be immediately banned. 

Obviously I realize this is a bit of an exaggeration.. but I am being somewhat serious. The same concept applies. A corporation is convincing an easily influenced child to desire their product... no different than a 22 year old convincing a 15 year old that sex is cool. "

6320,595,"So my coworkers and I were discussing strange events in the store that had happened (The front door opening without anyone there, movies falling off the rack [we work at an adult store.] the back door signal going off, ect...) and my friend brought up this story, I'm retelling it in first person view.

""My wife and I are editors for a local biker magazine. Its a fairly small magazine, and part of our job is to drive around between the towns in Southern Illinois, and drop off the magazines at various businesses. We had a new shop that was willing to carry our publication, so we were driving a different route than normal. It was about 5 in the morning, and we had just dropped off the last stack of magazines. We took an alternate road back, and saw an abandoned house just outside of some old farm land. 

Now, my wife and I, we love abandoned places. We keep a camera in our dashboard to take pictures of old structures and things like that. We pulled over to the side of the road and got out of the truck. My wife grabbed the camera and snapped a few pictures as we approached the front. The door was wide open, mind you, so we figured that nobody cared if someone came in. 

We only got about six steps in before we both felt an overwhelming feeling of dread - as if we had to get out right away. Every instinct in my body told me to run. My wife had already bolted back toward the truck, but I was a little curious. I took another step inside, and looked around. The feeling was overwhelming, and I couldn't take it so I followed suit and jumped back in the truck. My wife was in the driver seat this time. When she tried to turn on the car, the engine stalled, as if the battery was dead. Both of us started to panic for a second. The truck had no problems whatsoever, and had been running fine the entire day. 

I told my wife to pop the trunk, and I'd take a quick look under the engine. I didn't want to get out of the car, but I sure as hell didn't want to stay there either. She popped the trunk, and as soon as I opened the car door, the door to the abandoned house slammed shut. My wife revved the engine again, and the truck started up just fine. I closed the trunk and we got the fuck out of there. My wife is still freaking out, thinking the thing followed us home. Either way, it was creepy as hell, and we won't be taking that road again.""

I'm ready to settle down now and love Boston.  I lived there for two years, moved away 4 months ago to start a business, and will be moving back shortly.  The business never took hold and my pilgrimage back to Boston for New Years made me realize how much I love the city.

What are some great offices in the Boston area that encourage createve and collaborative work?  I do not want to be on a phone all day or behind a computer not engaging my coworkers.  If I had a job I think I'd be good at it would be event planning even though I have yet to hold a job in that industry.  Still, I'm willing to consider anything right now.  What do you suggest?

4731,462,"I recently became insured again, and I've decided I want to pursue WLS. I have an appointment with a General Practitioner for a checkup (haven't had one in years!) in a couple of weeks and I'm going to start with mentioning it to them. I'm afraid they're going to be anti-WLS and just try to lecture me on diet and exercise instead of being open to helping me go for it. If they do, there is a Bariatric doctor's office that I've passed here in town that I'll go to, since obviously they'll be willing to help me out. My boyfriend had the surgery two years ago and said the process with insurance took about 6 months to get approved, so I'm really hoping it doesn't take a lot for me to get that process officially started. I don't know which specific surgery I'll pursue just yet, but I'm nervous and excited about the whole thing.

Some background may help. I'm 24, 5'4-5'5, and my weight fluctuates from 270-280. I also have PCOS that causes anovulation and, consequently, infertility. One of my major motivations for surgery is to try to get my hormones back in gear so I can ovulate again and have babies one day.

Any advice for me when it comes to bringing this up to a doctor? Did any of you have trouble getting a doctor to work with you on pursuing surgery?"

particular capacities, character, propensities, and foibles of the single self. The knowledge it commands
means that of man's genuine reality −− of what is essentially and ultimately true and real −− of Reddit as the
true and essential being. Equally little is it the purport of mental philosophy to teach what is called
knowledge of men −− the knowledge whose aim is to detect the peculiarities, passions, and foibles of other
men, and lay bare what are called the recesses of the human heart. Information of this kind is, for one thing,
meaningless, unless on the assumption that we know the universal − man as man, and, that always must be Reddit. And for another, being only engaged with casual, insignificant, and untrue aspects of mental life, it

Thanks!"
11016,421,"This is kinda weird, but I don't like the concept of blame.  Of course, blame means different things, so let me define it.

A kid steals a cookie.  The mother finds out that a cookie is stolen, and knows that one of her two daughters did it.  By noticing the chocolate on Abby's face, she concluded that Abby is to ""blame"".  That's all well and good.  It was Abby's actions that resulted in the stolen cookie, and any punishment should be done to Abby, not Becky, who is completely innocent.  

If that is the definition of blame you're using, I have no problem with that.  You mustn't take my argument too literally.  When I say blame, I mean a certain kind of thing that's more than ascertaining which person did a certain deed.

Blame has a very negative connotation.  When you blame, you basically shame.  You generally don't blame people when they do something good, but you still hold them responsible for the good thing happening.  One example of blame is victim-blaming, which I hope we all agree is wrong.  Victim blaming is when, for example, you attempt to make a rape victim feel responsible for being raped...perhaps by acting promiscuous, or wearing a short skirt.  This is wrong...this girl shouldn't have been raped, and wasn't her fault.  Blaming her is more than simply telling her ""hey, you should be taking drinks from creepy guys"" but telling her ""Why the hell did you take that drink from that creepy guy?  Haven't you ever fucking heard of roofies?""

I argue that all blame does is slap a label on a person and saying ""This person is responsible for X occurring and should feel bad about it"".  And I think this approach is bad...for anything.

Bill is addicted to alcohol.  When people tell him to simply stop drinking he says that it isn't his fault...he has a disease.  Well, that seems too black and white to me.  Does his free will have a say in this?  Or is free will even a meaningful concept?  Other people may blame Bill for not wanting to be free from alcohol hard enough.  But can you simply will things like this?  Alcoholism is a result of a wounded mind, as is schizophrenia, but we don't tell schizophrenics to simply snap themselves out of it...same with people with phobias and...pretty much all mental illnesses.  You need to treat them, whether it's through medication, or simply talking to them.  

What should be done--and this is what AA attempts to do, whether you agree with their effectiveness or not--is to not simply shame the person, or to blame it all on the disease, but to fight against the disease, which you need willpower to do.

But that's a little offtopic.  My point is that all blaming seems to do is relocate responsibility.  It doesn't matter what it is, really; if we can point at one thing.  One person, or situation, or item, and say ""X is to blame for bad thing Y happening"", this oversimplifies the problem.  It puts everything on X without recognizing all the other factors.  I remember when father lost everything...his family, his home; he was homeless for a while.  And he blamed it all on his brother.  Whenever he talked about everything that happened on him, it always turned to what his brother did.  And sure, what his brother did was wrong, and it was pretty much the straw that broke the camel's back, but he isn't solely responsible for us losing our house, my father breaking his back, etc.  The financial problems, the marital problems, the increased tax rates, etc have nothing to do with him.  He's just a scapegoat.

What blame does is point at one person and saying ""You are entirely responsible for the bad stuff that happened, and you are the only person who can reverse it"".  It doesn't matter what it is, either.  A victim of a crime, a criminal, a mental illness sufferer, whatever.  It could be a genocidist for all I care.  I just don't understand how this is a helpful attitude to solve anything.  Instead of just dumping shame on someone, why not identify the causes of X and work to reverse or prevent X, together?  "

So, what are your recommendations?

**How the players got here:**

The three 2010 GSL Open Tournaments were to increase interest in SC2 and to determine who the top players were based on repeat performance. [The points were tallied](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/GSL_Rankings) and players 1-32 were seeded into this Code-S tournament. Players 33-64 were seeded into the Code-A tournament.

**How the 2011 GSL Tournament works:**

The tournament workflow is [best described by this chart](http://i.imgur.com/Ev5Jc.jpg) (thanks to adremeaux/puzzl). Note that there is also a separate Code-A tournament which is not pictured. The Code-A tourney is a normal single elimination format with 32 players for January.


**A note on The Code-A Tourney:**

     Ro32 through Semis: Bo3
     Finals: Bo7

Players who make it to Ro16 will be seeded into next season's tournament. The rest have to go through the open preliminaries/qualifiers for Code A next season. Players who reach Ro8 will play in the ""up and down"" matches against the Code-S players. The top 2 players will get to choose their opponents from the pool of ""up and down"" matches.

**A note on Code-S Ro32 Group Stage:**

     Player A = Previously Ranked 1-8
     Player B and D = Previously Ranked 17-32
     Player C = Previously Ranked 9-16

     Match 1: Player A vs Player B
     Match 2: Player C vs Player D

     Winner of match 1 vs Loser of match 2
     Winner of match 2 vs Loser of match 1
     
Top 2 players advance into Ro16 and stay in Code-S for next season. Players with 2 losses are dropped to the up-and-down matches to determine their Code for next season (see the chart linked above).

* If two players are 2-0 and two are 0-2, each tied pair plays a tiebreak game. (6 games total)

* If the outcome is 2-0, 1-1, 1-1, 0-2, the tied players play for the tiebreak. (5 games total)

* If all four players are tied 1-1, the two pairs of players who haven't faced each other will play. The previous result between newly tied players is used as a tie-break. (6 games total)

This means that there will be no endless tiebreaks and no games where a player is playing for nothing, like with normal round-robin format. Every match will be an important rank-deciding match.

Bowl Championship Series DECLARES GERMANY WINNER OF WORLD WAR II US Ranked 4th

 

&gt;After determining the Big-12 championship game participants the BCS computers were put to work on other major contests and today the BCS declared Germany to be the winner of World War II.

 --

&gt; ""Germany put together an incredible number of victories beginning with the annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland and continuing on into conference play with defeats of Poland, France, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands. Their only losses came against the US and Russia; however considering their entire body of work--including an incredibly tough Strength of Schedule--our computers deemed them worthy of the #1 ranking.""

 --

&gt; Questioned about the #4 ranking of the United States the BCS commissioner stated ""The US only had two major victories--Japan and Germany. The computer models, unlike humans, aren't influenced by head-to-head contests--they consider each contest to be only a single, equally-weighted event.""

 --

&gt; German Chancellor Adolph Hitler said ""Yes, we lost to the US; but we defeated #2 ranked France in only 6 weeks."" Herr Hitler has been criticized for seeking dramatic victories to earn 'style points' to enhance Germany's rankings. Hitler protested ""Our contest with Poland was in doubt until the final day and the conditions in Norway were incredibly challenging and demanded the application of additional forces.""

 --

&gt; The French ranking has also come under scrutiny. The BCS commented "" France had a single loss against Germany and following a preseason #1 ranking they only fell to #2.""

 --

&gt; Japan was ranked #3 with victories including Manchuria, Borneo and the Philippines."
6552,244,"Ok, this week is a bit different because there's no video.

[Week 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/eozp0/because_it_was_suggested_as_an_ongoing_topicfirst/) was Rotation, the basis and building block of the front crawl. Keep doing this for as long as you are swimming.

[Week 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/ewlq1/drill_of_the_week_front_crawl_fingertip_drag/) was Fingertip Drag. Integrate it into your stroke, easiest on warm ups.

[Week 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/f0u16/drill_of_the_week_3_frontcrawl_fist_drill/) was Fist Drill. More difficult and advanced but vital for building your skill. 

Keep doing all these regularly.

Now we're going to add the *effect* of them together. For stroke counting you need to get familiar with your usual number of stroke per length.

So for maybe 200 metres (or more if you like), count how many strokes you take each length. Ignore the first length. If you do it for 10 or 12 or more lengths, you will have a more accurate idea. If you do it when you are a little bit bit tired, you'll also have a better idea. 

Do it for a few days.

Let's say you are in a 25m pool. And you come up with an average figure of 25 individual arm strokes*. Once you know this you must start concentrating on trying to reduce this number, by using the techniques you are drilling on, rotating and streamlining. 

Do not think about going from 25 to 20 as this will seem impossible. Think about reducing by 1 stroke per length. Once this occurs, do it again. And again...

If your figure doesn't easily average, if it is quite different each length, (25, 21, 26, 23 etc), then you must concentrate on keeping your stroke smooth and even.

*A stroke in pool swimming is considered 2 arm movements, one of each arm. (In OW swimming a stroke is one arm movement).

** Next week hopefully, we'll have someone to take over backstroke for 4 weeks. 

And we'll return for another round of front crawl drills in 3 months time, all assuming someone will help out...

**EDIT:** While I swimming I thought I should simplify:

Swim speed = Distance per stroke (dps) x stroke rate (sr). 

Stroke counting is to address distance per stroke."

6142,185,I have a very particular request/favor for a valentines day present which would mean alot to me!. context = changing two normal people into two zombie people. I'd be really appreciative if u could help me!
6912,501,"I had a dream last night.  I was back at my (soon to be ex)husband's parents' farm.  My husband and I were sitting at a table, heads together, arms around each other.  His parents were being very hostile to me, but my husband told me we were going to be together and take care of each other, and everything was going to be ok.  I woke up crying.  I've been crying for most of the day.

I abused my husband.  I was terrible to him.  I refused to relinquish my friendships with my exes until he gave me the choice of him or them.  I continuously placed higher priority on my family, ignoring him for hours at a time when I went to visit my mother and sister.  I spoke of fond memories of other friends instead of building happy memories with him.  I cost him his job at a bar.

In spite of a life-long record of making bad decisions, I wouldn't yield to his authority.  When he told me I wasn't leaving the apartment, I tried to leap out a window.  When he took my car keys and cell phone, I punched him.  When he tried to defend himself, I bit, scratched, kicked, and screamed until he was forced to restrain me and choke me just to calm me down.  I damaged his guitars, kicked holes in the dry-wall, and scared his cat.

I was in total denial of my problem.  I found a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with bipolar and psychotic disorders, and I hid behind my diagnoses.  I found a counselor at a women's shelter who convinced me I was being abused.  My psychologist tried to call me out on my selfish bullshit but I refused to listen.  I left my husband after only 4 months of marriage, tearing out the door one day and running down the street, screaming my head off.

I was so delusional, I filed a restraining order against him.  We both lawyered up and he filed divorce papers.  I moved 500 miles to live with my mother.

It's only been in the last month or so that my delusions have started to come apart, thanks in large part to reddit.  I just filed papers to have the restraining order dropped.  I'm working with a social worker and a psychiatrist and I'm addressing my abusive thoughts and actions.  My husband wasn't the only victim.  I've terrorized my mother and sister as well.

Since having this dream, I just want to abandon everything and walk back to my husband.  I would leave my computer and cell phone.  I would forfeit my email addresses and cut all contact with my family.  I don't know if he would even have me back, but if he would, I'm sure a condition would be that we move somewhere extremely remote, where I haven't already damaged our social standing with my behavior.  I would cut my hair, throw out all my make-up, and take only the most modest of clothing.  I would stop listening to doctors instead of him.  I would stop taking my medication.

My husband always believed if I really wanted to, I could just ""be nice.""  I want to try, wholeheartedly, reserving nothing, holding back nothing, hiding behind nothing.

My husband said he had to protect the world from me.  I believe that now more than ever.  I need to be kept away from people.  I need to be restrained so I can't harm anyone else.  I've looked into long-term psychiatric commitment, but there are very few options.

6550,359,"Second guess yourselves.

Often that's bad advice, and a lot of us have passed up a lot of opportunities that we shouldn't have because we second guessed ourselves in our relationships, or our work, or in pursuing our ambitions. But when it comes to evaluating and discussing submissions that you see on reddit, second guessing yourself is a good thing.

I saw it because, more and more lately, I've been bothered by a tendency among redditors to talk to one another as though we need not consider other points of view. There are certain topics (politics is a very prominent example, but it's by no means the only one) where many of us talk as though we already knew the answers, and any suggestion otherwise is a position to be defeated, not considered.

A lot of times, it seems like the culprit is cynicism. If we don't know the truth about a given matter, it may seem like a safe bet to assume the worst. We haven't always earned that cynicism, and so it's especially important to second guess yourself when your inclination is adopt the cynical answer over a simple admission that you need to learn more before you can be sure.

Nor is it a sign of weakness to admit that we may never know some things.

It's different, of course, if you're an expert in a given field, talking to a novice. Reddit has its share of experts, and we appreciate those of you who *can* give us the considered opinion of years of work in a given field.

But for the most part, we all have a lot we can learn from reddit, and it would behoove us to behave as though that were the case.

Read the articles you vote and comment on. Try to avoid making comments that close down discussion. Take an interest in what the other person is saying, beyond simply looking for a way to defeat them in rhetorical combat.

There are a lot of people learning and sharing things on reddit on a daily basis, but they're steadily moving into specialty reddits. Meanwhile, some of the most visible large communities are given over to warring egos, and some of the smaller communities are virtually devoid of conversation because so few people feel that they have anything to learn from others.

The simple solution to those trends may be simply to make an effort at second guessing yourself. At any rate, it's worth a shot.

Thanks."

7551,595,"Even by writing this post I'm distracting myself from what I should be doing. But maybe you guys can offer me some advice that will help me get my sorry ass in gear.

I've got a problem with staying focused. I don't think I have ADD, as I never showed any signs of it as a kid. (I used to be able to sit down and just read for HOURS.) And I'm also convinced this is a mental problem that I created for myself, therefore I can overcome. Not something that is hard-wired that can be fixed by drugs. (I also am afraid to take ADD medication, as I hear it sucks the creativity out of a person.) 

Anyway, Its not a big enough deal that is affecting my life, but it does prevent me from doing things I want to do. I want to read more books, I want to learn to type in Dvorak and code in CSS. (I already know HTML from high school.) I want to knit a scarf, I want to finish writing a book. I want to do a lot of things. But its hard for me to concentrate on any one thing for an extended period of time. I can hardly even sit down and watch a full episode of something without watching it with someone else. 

Its hard for me to play video games without a break. Often I will pause, check facebook, check reddit, stumble a few times, then go back to what I was doing. I always have four or five tabs open to other things I want to do. 

I want to be able to concentrate on something, and really make a lot of progress, but my interest fades out so quickly I find myself putting down my book, or seeking some other form of entertainment for a short while. Its preventing me from really accomplishing anything.

I think this might be in part due to the fact I'm not in school anymore. When I was in high school, I didn't have the problem as bad. I took college classes, and was able to do fairly well. (But because of some mistakes and financial situations, I am now unable to go to class. Working on remedying that right now, however.) Now I'm working 4 days a week (nearly 40 hours, mind you.) and on the days I have off, I want to get shit done, but I'm struggling just to sit down to do anything. 

I recently started a blog, and it seems to be the only thing I can concentrate on for long periods of time. I can take half an hour writing out and polishing a new blog post, browsing for themes, looking at widgets. I think the interest though has something to do with the fact it is so new. I'm worried my interest in that will fizzle out and fade over time as well. 

TL;DR Can't concentrate on anything for longer than 5-15 minutes. Want to be able to focus and get shit done. Its unlikely that I have adult ADD. How do I whip my ass back into shape and learn to focus?"

Growing up, I have always been quite skeptical of how two indivisuals could be so compatible with each other, they happily spend the rest of their lives together; however today; I truly beleive we have all experienced the creation of such a beautiful formation.

Casey, your abundance of intelligence, integrity and critical thinking has always intimidated me, being your littlelest brother. I've always thought to myself ""There is none other who could meet such a level of sophisticated and caring qualities as you"". But I'm sure those thoughts are entirely attributed to you stepping me down a peg or two whenever we had quarrels. :)

And by stepping me down a peg or two, I mean socking me a good one. I mean, ""TEACHING ME A LESSON""

In actuallity, you have been such a loving a caring brother, son, and in recent status change, husband. You have always cared about our well being, and our quality of life. And for that, I have the deepest gratitude and love for you. 

And let this be known, If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have a fraction of the technical interests I have in life that I have now. Once again, I can't thank you enough. I love you brother.

Melissa, like I FALSELY said previously (in goofy voice­)""there is none other who could meet such a level of sophisticated and caring qualities as my oldest brother"", (serious voice) well... you certainly do. In fact, you excell at it. 

So of course Casey had to prove me wrong again.

Whenever I talk to you, Melissa, the conversation is full of so much intriqing content, and it is expressed so enthusiastically- that the passion in the room, is downright palpable. You have opened up the world, literally, to my oldest brother., and you continue to do the same with the rest of us. You exhibit so much care, love, and respect towards Casey, and his family, that: I am honored to finally officially call you my sister. Let this be known, that I have never had the opportunity to say this, but ....I love you sister. 

Deep sigh. Smile.

Ladies and gentlemen, today we have witnessed something beautiful. Today, we have witnessed something that has given myself, and hopefully other young indivisuals; that there IS such thing as true love. 

Casey and Melissa are both, some of the best people I know. Like.... top 5. :)
May their love flourish even more, and doing so- the love of those around them will flourish as well. 

And in the words of William Shakespeare
Grace and remembrance be to you both.

1235,632,"Apologies for the length and some of the stuff you might not need to know to help, but I have one of those personalities where I need to write everything down and be organized to keep myself accountable. 

**Backstory**

I've been a competitive swimmer since I was four years old. Up until I retired last year, I was swimming for a D1, Top 15 program. From 6-8 AM every morning (sans Sunday), I was doing one of these:

* 30-35 stations of different free weights and machines, 30 seconds of fast reps on, 15 seconds off between each station.
* A bunch of different stations of free weights and machines, but with a set number of reps on my own pace.
* Spinning class
* Swimming a practice geared toward long distance
From 2-4 PM every afternoon (sans Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday), I was swimming distance practices.

We had a dietician come in once a year, but I never really took it seriously and, being in college, I couldn't really afford to eat that well. Lots of fast food or dorm food. I wasn't on any supplements either. Combined with the fact that I was burning literally thousands of calories per day, the result was that my body didn't change at all. I've always been a small guy, and up until I retired I never weighed more than 155 pounds (I'm 6'1""). I don't know what my body fat percentage was, but I was compared to a stray dog more than once. 

Fast forward 8 months. In the time since I retired, I could count the number of times I worked out on my fingers and toes. The times that I actually go to the gym, I find myself with no idea of what to actually do. I do some abs, squats, or machines, but I never have concrete sets in mind when I go.

I haven't changed my diet at all. Additionally, with all the extra free time (and not having to wake up in the mornings), I have been going out drinking much more (multiple times per week). My weight is up to around 162 and I've developed a bit of a paunch that I'm really not happy with (I'd guess around 12% body fat). The sedentary lifestyle is not doing a lot for my mood, either. 

Probably the most important thing to know about me is that I have one of those personalities where I need to do something right, structured, or I just don't do it at all. I need schedules, order. I think that's why I haven't stuck to anything since retiring; I haven't had a set routine that included working out.

**Current**

I want to get fit again; in fact, I want to get more fit that I ever was with my swimming regime. New year, right? I've already implemented a few changes:

* Limit the amount of alcohol I drink. I'm only going to go out once or twice a week, and I'm not going to let myself get drunk like I used to. I've recently had some personal revelations about the way I interact with people (part of why I'm doing this), and I realized that the amount I was drinking was ridiculous and that I don't need it.
* Not counting alcohol, I'm only going to drink water and green tea. I was never much of a soda drinker, but I did drink a lot of juice and lemonade that had disgusting amounts of sugar in them. I got myself a Brita pitcher and fill it up every morning, so that's my go-to now when I'm thirsty.

Here are the main goals I'd like to accomplish.

* Get up to 170 pounds. I'd like to do this while also losing the fat I've put on since I stopped swimming. Make as much of it muscle as possible. 
* Get in shape to run a marathon. Ideally, I'd like to run one by this summer.
* Start eating right. I haven't changed my diet at all (still way too much fast food and bad shit) because I just have no clue what it needs to be like to accomplish my goals.

**Here's where you come in!**

I honestly have no clue what to do. I've tried reading the FAQ and a few websites about diet and all that, but there's just so much information, so many different specialized programs, that I'm having trouble figuring out which one is going to help me. I'm not out of shape, but I'm not in shape. I can run a 5k no problem (the runs I would go on when I did them were usually around 6 miles), and the last time I worked out (probably a month ago), I did 3x8 200 lb squats (though I don't think I was going quite parallel). However, I can barely do 3x8 100 lb benches, and I didn't even try deadlifts. I'm some gooey blob of an athlete without a sport.

So, experts of Fittit, what do you think? What kind of diet do I need to be on to trim my fat and build the first real muscle of my life? What sort of workout? I know I have the willpower to do what it takes (hell, I woke up at 4:30 every day of high school), I just need direction and a routine."

10820,136,"Many of us, especially women, are deficient in calcium and magnesium. In fact, having a magnesium deficiency actually decreases the amount of calcium in your body! That’s because magnesium is necessary for calcium absorption. Supplementing with calcium won’t drastically improve your calcium levels if you don’t have adequate magnesium levels. So what is magnesium, and why is it so important?

Magnesium is an essential mineral that is involved in more than 300 enzyme reactions. The suggested RDA is 300-400 mg for healthy adults, but many of us get less than 150 mg a day. Low levels of magnesium can cause irritability, headaches, muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat, muscle spams or twitches, constipation, and insomnia. Magnesium helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and promotes strong bones. Magnesium is involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. The metabolism of carbohydrates and fats depends on magnesium as the body requires it for completing certain chemical reactions. It’s also important to note that the antioxidant glutathione requires magnesium for its synthesis. Glutathione is crucial for detoxification activities within the body and for the immune system.

One of the key benefits magnesium provides is relaxation. It relaxes the muscles and helps calm the nervous system. For women suffering from headaches, nervousness, or tension, magnesium supplements can help to ameliorate these conditions. An increase in magnesium will also promote strong bones by improving calcium absorption. Certain forms of magnesium are more available to the body, such as magnesium glycinate or citrate. Avoid magnesium oxide, which is a cheap version not used well by the body.

Natural, dietary sources include: green leafy vegetables, seaweed or green algae, avocados, nuts, beans, and grains such as brown rice and millet. Caffeine depletes the body’s stores of magnesium. It’s easy to see why the majority of the American population is deficient, given our lack of vegetable consumption and high intake of coffee and soda. Taking a hot bath with Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) is a relaxing way to absorb this important mineral.

While calcium and magnesium are important minerals for bone strength and overall health, many women are unaware of certain valuable nutrients available for breast health. Just as women care for their bones, there are also natural ways to care for the health of their breasts. Compounds such as DIM (diinodolymethane, found in cruciferous vegetables), quercetin, and turmeric extract continue to demonstrate health benefits for women. DIM, an ingredient found in broccoli, has been well-researched for its ability to support healthy estrogen metabolism.

6788,453,"I was kinda tired of hunting around for a group, so I figured, ""why not start one?"". Come ride around in a sweet van and raid/solve mysteries/acquire phat loot. I'm calling first dibs on a partner when we split up, someone else can have Velma. &gt;.&gt;
 
This is for people in the guild that have little or no Cata raiding experience, but would really like to find a group. The only requirements I'm going to throw out right now are at least a 340 plus item level, and a willingness to learn. I'm a firm believer that patience and intelligence are your best assets in a raid group. Also, you should be dedicated to progression. That means showing up every time if at all possible, or notifying me beforehand if you can't make it. Hey, it's life, things pop up all the time. However, this is a total waste of time if we don't progress.

Raid times are subject to change, depending on who's available when. (Although eventually more solid raid times will be in effect.) I have class Tuesday and Thursday from about 8 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon, server time. (So we CAN raid on M/W as well, as long as its not a late night. Late = later than 1 in the morning.) Other than that any weekday is acceptable.

I'm looking to start on Blackwing Descent, if at all possible. What I'm looking for in raid composition is:


Tank - Wodon, Pally Tank

Tank

Melee DPS #1 - Vallos, Frost/Unholy DK. 

Melee DPS #2 - Malicios, Rogue

Ranged DPS #1 - Scoobs, Rogue

Ranged DPS #2 - Alzin, Fire Mage

Ranged DPS #3

Healer #1

Healer #2 - Lonepine, Resto Druid

Healer #3 - Auratorio, Holy Priest

Just a note - there will be a core 10 man team, but feel free to apply anyway if we are full up. I'll put you on reserve, and if someone can't make it you'll be first in line.

Post with your name, ilvl, and any relative experience/professions. If you think you might be interested, start reading up on bosses SOON. I would like to get started next week, and there's only so much you can convey in a 3 minute explanation on mumble. Watch some videos if you need to. Lastly, if you have any questions you can post here or message me in-game on my main Vallos, or my alt Valmaeg. Anyone that would like to offer suggestions in the forming of the group is more than welcome. I'm not here to boss you around or be a dick about stuff, I'm here for *you* and to get things done. :D

8939,544,"WAYWT = What Are You Wearing Today. It doesn't necessarily need to be what you were wearing TODAY.

It's a good idea to:

* **edit your first post with additional pictures**, and post as often as you like.
* include what the attire is for (some people are going to work, some to school, some are simply hanging out in suburbia)

Pictures are incredibly encouraged as it's quite tough to imagine what someone else is wearing without them.

**Critiquing others is welcome and encouraged, but keep it constructive/factual.** Take a lesson from Dale Carnegie's [How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People) if needed. It takes balls to post pictures of yourself on the Internet, the least you can do is accord the same courtesy as you would to someone in real life.

* I think this would look better with an oxford shoe
* I don't think that type of shirt is quite in fashion, have you considered somethign like *this*?

* That shirt is ugly, so are you, you ugly, ugly man. Everything about you is ugly.

But don't they frustrate you sometimes? When you get sniped by your spawn point or in the middle of the field, in say, hemorrhage. Or when they severely damage or destroy a Wraith or Banshee.

## Stats

&gt; Male or female?
&gt;&gt; I'm a dude.

&gt; Age?
&gt;&gt; 29 ½

&gt; Relationship Status?
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, look at my [girlfriend](http://i.imgur.com/NBsDc.jpg)! :D

## Favorites

&gt; Cats or Dogs?
&gt;&gt; Dogs are awesome and really fun, but I prefer cats due to lower maintenance.

&gt; Favorite beverage?
&gt;&gt; Milk or Grape soda. I don't drink alcohol because it tastes like crap, and I've never been drunk. I don't like Coca Cola either, actually, except for Vanilla Coke. Go figure...

&gt; Food?
&gt;&gt; Sushi and Kebab.

&gt; Favorite movie and tv shows?
&gt;&gt; Movies: The Maxx, Labyrinth, Amélie, La Vita è Bella, My Sassy Girl (Korean original), Watchmen, Avatar and everything Ghibli.

&gt;&gt; TV Series: Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Farscape, Doctor Who, Gilmore Girls, Veronica Mars, House, Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, Hajime no Ippo.

&gt; Music?
&gt;&gt; [Snowave](http://www.snowavemusic.com/), Jean Michel Jarré and Metallica. I mostly listen to soundtracks and [Digitally Imported](http://www.di.fm/) web radio though. Especially when I'm programming.

&gt; Book?
&gt;&gt; Hitch-hiker's Guide and every other Douglas Adams book. Jackie Chan's book was a great read, too. Other than that, I'd say my favorite books are Graphic Novels, like Y - The Last Man and Battle Angel Alita. I mostly read books about game design and web development.

&gt; Game?
&gt;&gt; I'm a huge fan of old SNES games and 2D arcade games (Metal Slug FTW!). Zelda is my favorite game series, then Harvest Moon, I think. I love ICO, Shadow of the Colossus, Silent Hill 1 and 2, God of War, SSX, and Katamari. For PC it's Monkey Island, Emperor - Rise of the Middle Kingdom, Fallout 1 and 2, World of Goo and Aquaria. My proudest gaming achievement is probably finishing Abe's Odyssey and Abe's Exodus. I'm not really a fan of FPS games, but I really enjoyed HL2 and Portal is amazing.

&gt; What is your favorite word or quote or expression?
&gt;&gt; I have a bunch of them:

&gt;&gt;
* ""Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in getting up every time we do."" - Confucius

&gt;&gt;
* ""Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."" - Antoine de Saint-Exupery

&gt;&gt;
* ""Half mat, whole mat, a fistful of rice."" - Japanese proverb

&gt;&gt;
* ""Life passes most people by while they're making grand plans for it."" - George (Johnny Depp), Blow

&gt;&gt;
* ""And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom."" - Anaïs Nin

## Miscellanea

&gt; What makes you laugh?
&gt;&gt; I mostly enjoy subtle, intelligent and a bit of dark humor. For instance, [PartiallyClips](http://partiallyclips.com/) is probably the best web comic ever, and represents my humor exactly. Also, Calvin and Hobbes, of course.

&gt; What is your biggest pet peeve?
&gt;&gt; Poor information and organization. You know, like when you can't find the price on something in a store, the name of what street you're on, or proper contact information on a webpage. Drives me nuts.

&gt; What general area of your country you live in?
&gt;&gt; Right in the middle of Stockholm, Sweden.

&gt; Do you love it?
&gt;&gt; Yes, but I want to move to the neighbor town of Uppsala, where my girlfriend lives. That place is awesome!

&gt; What was the best thing about the last 12 months?
&gt;&gt; Living together with my girlfriend and [her best friend](http://www.youtube.com/user/annaunderscore) in Uppsala during the summer. That was all kinds of awesome. Unfortunately it was only temporarily, as we couldn't find a new apartment when our contract was up.

&gt; What are you looking forward to in the next 12 months?
&gt;&gt; Finishing three huge projects I'm working on, getting some real money at last and finding a new apartment where we all can move in again.

&gt; If you were granted one do-over, what would It be?
&gt;&gt; I think I only regret not having saved up more money through the years. Then again, I've had a lot of fun in exchange for frugality.

&gt; A butterfly flaps its wings... what small thing have you done or said that lead to something disproportionately larger?
&gt;&gt; Well, I was very poor at one time, lived in a bomb shelter, survived on one bowl of rice a day and was generally miserable. Then I applied for my (then) dream job, and was employed with a great salary the very next week. In the following months, I managed to move in to a proper apartment, go on a six weeks long journey with my best friends (transsiberian railway through Russia to Mongolia, then to China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand), and then met my awesome girlfriend, too. This was three years ago.

&gt; All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you?
&gt;&gt; My friends and family, obviously, but other than that, having the freedom to live life according to my own vision.

## Concerning Reddit

&gt; What is the origin or meaning of your user name?
&gt;&gt; Well, my real name is Frank, and I'm very fond of Japanese stuff. ""Ichiro"" is a popular name in Japan, meaning stuff like ""first born, one way, bright, clear, straight, earnest"", which is pretty similar to what ""frank"" means (I'm the first born, too).

&gt; Total number of reddit identities you’ve had?
&gt;&gt; Except for two poorly maintained novelty accounts, this is my only one.

&gt; What is your favorite part of reddit?
&gt;&gt; The diversity and all the awesome things we manage to accomplish as a community.

&gt; What do you do when you’re not on reddit?
&gt;&gt; You mean when my facebook and twitter tabs are in front of it? No, I pretty much do three things: Work on my games and website projects, watch tv-series and movies, or hang out with my girlfriend and other friends. That's pretty much my life in a nutshell.

&gt; How has reddit changed in the last year or so?
&gt;&gt; More cool features is the only real change I've noticed.

## Final Question

&gt; Is there anything you'd like to plug/promote/advocate?
&gt;&gt; Well, there is my friend [Snowave](http://www.snowavemusic.com/) who's also my favorite musician. I'm basically his manager and I've done all the artwork, the webpage and even organized the albums. There's about 8 hours of music there you can download for free if you like it, and even more will be released soon. You might have heard some of it on Radio Reddit, too. :)

&gt;&gt; About a year ago, I had an idea about redditors sending a Bobblehead to each other around the world, and we even got one signed by the entire reddit staff! The project is still active and the subreddit is here. I really need to update the [official webpage](http://www.bobbleheadadventures.com/) though…

&gt;&gt; A month ago I got very involved in [ProjectCairo](http://www.reddit.com/r/projectcairo/), which is a very interesting but tricky ""open effort to restore and bring life into the heavily subverted city of Cairo, Illinois (USA), and turn it into a thriving community"". This could really use some more attention, as it's much more likely to happen than Reddit Island, for instance.

&gt;&gt; Also, I just started the [MovieLists subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/movielists/), which will hopefully evolve into something fun.

&gt;&gt; My personal webpage is [here](http://www.frankoddbratt.com/)."

10053,510,"The arcades started out as mechanical devices, then video games came in to being and much later the arcades died out (in North America) I think going back to the beginning with later arcade design would be some thing to behold.

A half life sized mechanical Street Fighter officially licensed. You would have the same arcade controls and be five feet back. The animatronic puppets would be high up enough to be just above you eye line. The ""projectiles"" would be from a matrix of neon tubes behind the animatronics and effect them the same apon impact as if they were sprites. There could be three characters per side hidden behind this devices where on a track they go in to a back drop hole and switch out.

This would be toured at fairs and malls, it has the advantage of being a unique experience to go out for and completely uncopyable in the home, something that killed arcades. That's it. That's my idea!

2566,578,"Someone mentioned on one of the food-related reddits recently about baking bacon and having done it, I can't believe I didn't do it sooner. I messed around with it because I had a few ideas. Here's a few things:

350 degrees? Yes. And the reason is simple. If you go any higher, the drippings burn. What if you want it crisp? I'll get to that.

Drippings. I put my bacon on a stainless steel sheet (with edges, not a flat one) with a wire rack on it. Works like a charm.

The instructions say to cook for 20-25 minutes. I agree with that, except 20 is the upper limit. Start the bacon in the oven, finish over a frying pan. Or, even better - don't finish the bacon. Wrap it in foil and a baggie/container and put it back into the fridge. It comes back perfectly, just as if it were fresh. A minute or two on the frying pan and you have crisp bacon that you would not know wasn't fresh cooked.

Frozen bacon? Not a problem. Did that as well. Thawed one in the fridge, the other thawed in the oven. Now you know what to do with frozen bacon you didn't pay attention to. After it starts to get cooked a bit, take it out of the oven, separate the rashers and lay them out.

Whether the bacon was refrigerated, frozen, cooked to completion the first time or cooked again later, the bacon came out the same - delicious. You lose a lot of the grease doing it this way which is nice. The bacon is like regular bacon in that if you take it off the heat while it's a little soft and put it on paper towels, it will crisp up on it's own as it drains into the towel.

Really, everything about is genius. Even the possible downside which is the time is fine. I don't even preheat the oven. It doesn't matter. You just have to eyeball it and take it out before it starts to shrink too much. I just prep the rest of the meal and let the bacon do it's thing. 

Happy baconaking!"

Giffords' alleged shooting have so far yielded little pro-Tea-Party material...but the very nature of his act should have been a clue that just because this maniac surfaced (months) after a politically-charged election, doesn't mean that Palin/Beck/Tea Partiers are prime motivators.

Think of past politically-motivated killings. You don't even have to go back that far...last week, [a prominent governor from Pakistan's secular party was gunned down](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/world/asia/06pakistan.html) for arguing against blasphemy laws. The shooter was one of his own guards who calmly pumped 20-some bullets into his target before giving himself up to police, and has since made no secret of his anger over the governor's anti-blasphemy stance.

In contrast, Gifford's shooter reportedly shot her once in the face, and then indiscriminately fired into the crowd, and even at a 9-year-old. Even [John Hinckley Jr.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagan_assassination_attempt) was more discriminate in his shooting. The killer behind the most recent Congressmember assassination [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allard_K._Lowenstein](40 years ago) was declared insane.

Assassinations that we *do* strongly suspect to be politically motivated, including Harvey Milk's and Abraham Lincoln's, did not involve a shooter who unloaded his gun into every nearby target.

So given the history of political attacks...people's initial reaction to hearing that a not-that-liberal Democrat was shot in a very-gun-friendly-state, along with a dozen other bystanders, is that Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck have blood on their hands?

I'm not going to issue a blanket statement against Redditors...but just looking at reactions from some of the prominent bloggers I read: In the past, they have **rightfully** argued that correlation does not imply causation when it comes to religious proof and protecting a minority group from being blamed for the actions of a one wacko...does that not apply to the Tea Partiers?"

8307,17,"So this morning was my PT test for the navy base police academy. I appreciate all of the help i got from my last post so felt i should do an update. I completed my 20 required pushups, however i had 3 that ""didn't count"" and it was pretty demoralizing! I pushed through and got it done though.

The mile and a half run was a whole other story. I got through the halfway point at a pretty decent time. (for me) However my shins and the sides of my calves gave out. I had the hardest time lifting my toe off of the ground. I didn't buy running shoes, i was using cross trainers that i had been running in previously, and i read that wearing brand new shoes on run day is a bad thing. So first things first now that i failed is to buy new shoes. Secondly i will be starting my run every day. Cardiovascular endurance i was worse off than i thought, so i have until march 17th to improve.

I couldn't sleep last night, i maybe slept for 4-5 hours if that, and i was running in my dreams and working out and i just felt tired before i began. I know it was a lot to push myself, but i have to keep going! I will keep you guys posted on my progress, but losing weight and getting this mile and a half done is goal #1. Even if i don't make the academy i am determined to be in better shape now.

The color scheme, from what I recall, was pretty brown, and the player-character was taller and thinner than Mario's sprite (Even when big)

The downsides, I can't really think of any - I'll be living in an ordinary flat so Trigoniulus corallinus crawling over my face while I'm asleep are not a concern (as opposed to living in some rainforest hut or something) and I'm not a fan of very soft mattresses anyway.

2751,557,"I signed up for a 13.1 at the end of the month. My longest run ever was 8 miles as of 11/15/10. I've been training hard to get ready for the 13.1. Time is running out and I realize i have a few crucial problems with my training.

1. The 13.1 starts at 6am. I never run earlier than 9am and oftentimes much later in the day.

2. I don't know anything about pre/during/post nutrition and hydration. Do I need to get some gel snack thing? Please recommend. I tend to eat a banana or some cereal (or both) and drink some water before a long run... and binge (pasta, fruit, chicken, chocolate, juice, tons of water, nothing too bad) the rest of the day. I know I'm not doing this right. 

3. I have flat feet and wear doctor made orthotics to give me some arch. These were made years ago to help alleviate some knee pain associated to my flat feet (something about my q-angle?).  My knees hurt during the run and after. I ice. I remember seeing a post recently from a 22yr old that has constant clicking/cracking on his knees when he bends his legs. I have that too (since i was a kid) and I suspect years of weight training (squats, etc.) and physical activity have been tough on my knees particularly where they click/crack.

4. I tend to take my phone with me on my runs to track the distance with the GPS. With certain shorts the phone bangs against my leg and it feels like a hammer hitting my thigh with every step. I should probably just stop wearing those shorts. I use jogtracker android app.

5. My pace is about 10-11 minute miles no matter how far i run. WTF?

6. I have a busy work schedule and some weeks only do one long run on the weekend. Other weeks I will squeeze in 1 or 2 during the week as well (usually 3-5 miles). Weak i know. Over the holiday break i was able to run a lot more which got me to 12.5 i believe.

7. I use new balances.

8. My long runs are getting really brutal, I am already considering doing the 13.1 and then never running more than 4 miles again. Originally I thought I might be able to do a full marathon after this 13.1. But I feel like I'm running on 90% heart and 10% brain. In other words, I think I am doing this all wrong. 

Runnit, please post some practical and economic advice to help me improve and be able to keep running long term. 

**EDIT**: Regarding my phone: You know one thing I havent mentioned yet, is that a big reason i take my phone on my jogs (aside from its GPS/jog tracking function) is that i will also have my bluetooth earpiece in my ear while i jog and literally have conversations with ppl WHILE I'm jogging. I realize this may be weird, but hear me out.. I believe it is actually good to speak some while doing cardio because it is more challenging and works your lungs harder, so you doing it when you aren't talking is easier, plus it distracts me/you/us. I've found that sometimes I will feel completely spent, then I will call someone up and before I know it I've run another 3 miles lost in a conversation. Granted it might also distract from my form. And yes, people on the phone can tell i am jogging.

I also *always* wear my 1st gen ipod shuffle (not for sale! lol), one ear bud in bc of the bluetooth, or i pocket the bluetooth and wear both earbuds..... and jam to my jams. Some of the songs really motivate me even though I've heard them a thousands of times.

I was considering talking on the phone for maybe 20-30 min during my 13.1...but I'm leaning towards not right now. Comments with respect to this edit are welcome. "

* Make sure your scale is on a flat, level, solid surface. In particular, do not put your scale on the carpet. If your weight seems to change when you rotate the scale, the surface is not level.
* Wear the same clothes (or lack thereof) whenever you weigh yourself.
* Always weigh yourself at the same time each day.
* Urinate or defecate if possible before weighing yourself.
* Adopt a consistent stance when standing on the scale."

Game-play was (as far as I can recall) similar to a 3d chutes and ladders.  There were cylindrical fireman that you moved around gameboard on each floor.

Since it is a public university, she is considered a state worker, and must pay into the mandatory state retirement system.  This would be normally fine, but the employer withholds nothing for Social Security, so we are left holding the bag at the end of the year when the tax man comes and we have to pay in her entire contribution to social security.

Is this just the way it is, or am I doing my taxes incorrectly.  My wife and I make roughly $55k a year, and it really sucks that it seems that I still have to pay out $600 in a lump sum payment because my wife is in a mandatory retirement system which not only will not pay out unless she works there 15 years, but also deducts from the number of quarters contributed to social security (she has been there for 2 years now), therefore increasing her retirement age.  

As far as I see it, we still have to pay into the social security system which is not ""marking off"" her contribution quarters due to her employer not making contributions, yet having to contribute to a retirement system that she will likely see no benefit from, as we plan to leave the state.  It's goddamn extortion.

State is LA, if anyone has any suggestions.  My main issue is that we can't afford a tax preparer, so if your suggestion includes that, please keep it to yourself.

I’ve never been able to get my hands on one of their anniversary additions before so you can imagine my delight when I found Old Rasputin XII at my local Whole Foods. Although, it was $21 for a 500ML…ouch. It bloody well better be worth it. This beer is 11.2% alcohol by volume and is aged in oak bourbon barrels.

**Appearance: 4/5**

As black as can be. It couldn’t possibly be any darker. The thin head was a coffee color.

**Aroma: 5/5**

Extremely sweet due to the bourbon. Hint of vanilla, chocolate, and coffee. And by “hint” I mean the type of “hint” your girlfriend gives you when she thinks you could do with a few more sit-ups.

**Palate : 4/5**

A little bit of a tingly bitey sensation due to the 11.2% ABV. It was sufficiently smooth however. Just make sure you sip slowly.

**Flavor: 5/5**

BOURBON! I am strongly reminded of John Henry 3 Lick Spiker Ale. The alcohol doesn’t come through as a flavor but more as a warm sensation when you exhale. The dominant sensation was the chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and caramel. It was sweet ALMOST to the point of being cloying, but not quite. I loved it!

**Overall:  18/20**

At $21 I don’t think I’ll be getting this again; as much as that pains me. This might have to become a once a year beer for me.

Sip slowly and enjoy in good company!"

I have to assume that codeine that is dissolved in the water is lost in the filter as well.

When the filter is wet it appear to just filter normally, but it is possible that the codeine is still getting stuck in the filter, while the other water is being displaced. I usually pour some water in afterwords, then squeeze the filter.

1125,161,"During one of my recent games I decided to take a shot at Marathon Pro. I had 2/3 challenges complete, and all I needed were the 15 flag captures in Capture the Flag. I dove in, and after a few games, decided it be best to compile a list of what to do and what not to do when you play Capture the Flag!

Without further ado,


**Do:**

* Determine your role on the team. Defending is just as important as being on the offensive and working toward the flag. If everyone is rushing for the flag, stay back and help defend - it'll immensely help the team if you do!

* If your team has the flag, defend the flag carrier! Everyone on the other team will be gunning for him, the more people to cover him and ensure he makes it home safely, the better.

**Don't:** (these don'ts come from personal experience in games);

* Play a fucking game of Team Deathmatch. There's a gametype with hundreds of thousands of players playing it, you should try it. If you're not going to actually play Capture the Flag and not contribute to the team, we'd be better off without you.

* If I have the flag and I'm waiting for it to be returned, please, PLEASE, someone stick around and help me. Contrary to what some teammates seem to believe, I cannot hold off an entire 6-man team by myself while you guys dick around. Even one person to hang back with me is far better than having no one at all.

* On that very same note, if I'm waiting with the flag for our flag to be returned, actually make an effort to find the flag carrier. I know, unless he's currently visible by a teammate or you have a spy plane (which you all should be running), he's not visible on the map like in MW2 days. Guess what, find him anyway. I bet I know where he'd be...near his flag maybe? Try that before you all decide to run fucking circles around the map killing anyone and everyone you see.

* Remain silent. A coordinated team is far superior than a team that has zero communication. Even randoms can come together and form some simple sentences to win a game. I always do my best to relay what I'm doing and anything important (e.g. where the enemy flag carrier is, etc), and there's no reason why you shouldn't do the same (except if you don't own a mic).

* This is 100% serious, and I've seen it on multiple occasions, could someone explain this to me please? Don't, I repeat, DO FUCKING NOT take their flag and hide somewhere NEAR THEIR BASE until time runs out. I have zero idea why this happens but it's happened in half of the 5-6 games I've played. I can't find a challenge or anything that would explain why people would do this. This is **CAPTURE** the Flag, not **GET AND HIDE SOMEWHERE WITH** the Flag. Also see my first ""don't point"".

That's all I can think of for now, but I think the basic point gets across.

**Play the appropriate gametype, people.**"

A number of people, myself included, view him as a right/center authoritarian who favours deregulated liberal capitalism and is strongly allied with megacorporate interests. Myself, I don't believe he's a good leader for what passes for the Left in the US these days. I'd prefer to set up with someone who is willing to push left instead of allowing himself to be dragged even further right. But I'm prone to jumping at shadows. So I'd like to hear your thoughts on President Obama. We've got another Presidential Election coming up in a few yeas. Do you think the left such as it is should throw their weight behind Mr. Obama again? Or should we look for a new representative? "
321,425,"In the span of one year I lost my fiance due to her cheating, my job, my aunt to cancer and another failed relationship. After my fiance, I tried to commit suicide. Luckily, it did not work. So I picked up and moved towns. I had to get away from the small town my fiance and I 
lived in.


From there I developed a drinking/ drug problem. I ruined relationships around me, a career and my mental stability. I tried suicide a few times after that- for whatever reason unsuccessful. On May 24, 2009 I was hospitalized and held because of a suicide attempt. This was what made me decide to seek help. 

I have tried to attempt suicide once more past that. Something that really hurt my body. I still have suicidal thoughts at low points in my life. But I know that there are people that rely on me- that love me- and that would be at a loss without me.

I am talking about this because I want to get the point to everyone on SW that we all fight a hard battle. If you see us offering to help people on SW it is because some of us have been there. We know what depression and suicide is like. We know the importance of seeking help.

My life was saved many, many times by just having my two best friends to talk to. They stayed up with me on those nights I was crying, drunk or just delusional. They would wake up at four in the morning to answer my texts. They were that miracle that I needed. That is why we do it- we were once in your shoes. We have walked that same path. We want to be there for you. Please seek help if you need it!"

I am a big guy 6'3"" 376lbs. I have lifted weights off and on since high school (football player). My lowest post high school weight has been about 310, at the time i was working out daily, could bench something like 335 and deadlifting I think around 400lbs (this may be wrong, it was a long time ago). 

Ive put on a ton of weight (obviously) and lost a lot of that stregth. I am working to get it back and cut the fat down a lot, but noticed that while I dont have a 6-pack by any means, there are noticable lines where that 6pack would be, they are significantly more defined when I raise my arms or suck in my stomach.

Why is it that with so much fat, I can still see the outline of muscle? I have a big stomach. Its by far the largest fat store on me, and I have always thought it was disproportinate to the rest. Is it possible that I just have an abnormal Visceral fat store, which then doesnt hide the muscle as much as standard over the muscle fat would? Or is this normal?"

8796,176,"**This was originally written about two months ago, but only to myself. I have decided to post this story to see what you all think of it. Everything is true and actually happened to me...**

At 5AM this morning I was doubled over with pains in my stomach. I didn't know what was happening so I eventually took myself to the ER because I was scared. Sure enough, it was my lovely ovaries again, on fire with burning cysts. But now that it's taken care of, and that image is in your brain, I can look back on the most surreal and horrifying six hours I have ever spent in a hospital.

When I arrived it was still dark outside and I got right in. My hopes of a quick in-and-out would soon be dashed though, as I waited in agony for three hours in my room before a doctor even saw me. I was told they were ""in the middle of a report"". In fact, the odd thing about my entire stay today was that the ER was not busy. I have been to the ER many times and I know what busy looks like. My nurse was a little old apathetic woman who did not care about anything I said. I was in tears asking for Motrin and when I asked her again twenty minutes later, she hadn't even gone to check with my doctor yet. Out of the six hours I spent laying in the bed, I would say less than twenty minutes of that was spent with a nurse, doctor, or x-ray tech in my presence. It was a lonely, lonely time. My insides burned and my eyes blurred from the yellow lights above my head. One hour in and I had a throbbing headache.

The entire time, there were three County Sheriffs sitting on metal folding chairs right outside my room. If it wasn't for their voices, the ER would have been a tranquil place. These guys talked the whole time. They gossiped like women, talking about their training, their wives, their sports teams and their jock-itch. I heard everything and they did not shut up. Every time they laughed my head pounded. I realized they must have been escorting a jailbird to the ER for treatment, and they had to stand guard by the door, but three of them? And the lack of regard for the otherwise peaceful, quiet area was sickening. They acted like they were in a bar.

While I was waiting for x-rays, I laid in the bed day dreaming, trying to fall asleep. I was aware of the presence in the room on the other side of the curtain. I was sharing a room with who I would eventually figure out was a man. Judging from his voice he was maybe in his 30's or 40's. Voices other than the three Sheriffs at the door got my attention and I snapped to, hoping it was my doctor, a nurse, or someone there to move my progress in the ER along. I was very wrong. I heard a Doctor introduce herself to the patient a few feet away. The curtain blocked my view of everything. I heard the door to the room shut, muffling the voices of the cops outside and the tap-tap-tap of ER computers. It was suddenly very quiet. 

The Doctor then proceeded to ask the Patient several questions about his ailment, if he had anyone to take care of him, something about registration and an emergency contact. Then she began talking to him about symptoms he was having and then a test that he had had done. I briefly became aware that I was eavesdropping but what could I do? It was a tiny space, smaller than an average bedroom. Divided down the middle with a curtain. I heard the Doctor clear her throat, say the patients name to him, and then the words ""You have tested positive for HIV.""

More talking occurred, the man seemed shocked but almost like it hadn't hit him fully at first. The Doctor spoke with him about options, treatments, the advancement of medicine over the years, and then she left. Then the man started crying. Weeping, I should say. I wanted to talk to him, my brain got fuzzy, I didn't know what to do. Should I do anything? Pretend to be asleep? Maybe he didn't know I was there. I contemplated many options quickly when the door opened again and he was whisked away to be admitted upstairs. I put my hand on my head, realizing what I had just witnessed, fighting back tears of my own, when I was interrupted to be taken for x-ray.    

After I had x-rays I was back in the room, alone this time. As I was waiting to be told that I too, was dying, another long lull filled with drunken cop banter and pressure headache continued. I was very scared for my results, so when an older grandma-type lady with a clipboard walked in and asked if she could ""talk"" with me, the terror inside me peaked. My mind raced and I wanted to cry. The lady had a hospital name tag and she remained silent while pulling a chair up to the side of my bed. I was frozen in fear and waited. But she didn't say anything about my health. 

""Tell me about yourself"", she said. What? I was angry and confused but I honestly thought she was going to break some kind of bad news to me so I didn't want to be rude. ""Uhmm, like what?"" This went on for a few minutes while I eyed her strangely and fought back tears. I told her where I was from with a shrug, what my major is in college with an awkward wince and then I finally broke. ""Why do you want to know?"", I responded rudely to one of her questions. She continued to beat around the bush while I gave in, patiently telling her a few things about myself like where I was from and why I was in the hospital. She offered lame and generic responses like ""I'm sure you hope to feel better soon"" and ""wow, living in Michigan must have been real neat"". 

Then, when I was about to crack with frustration and fear, she laid it on me. ""Is there a place for Jesus Christ in your life?"". I knew it. My mind swirled and I wanted to strangle this poor old woman. Instead I looked her in the eye, paused a minute and replied ""I am an Atheist."" She was visibly annoyed with *me* this time, even slightly rolling her eyes toward the wall. ""Why is that?"" She asked. I was so fed up with this conversation, which was now going on 45 minutes that I propped myself up and while turning myself away from her to lay the opposite direction I replied ""Science"".  

I laid there for a minute closing my eyes, expecting her to just walk out of the room and leave me alone. A minute ticked by in silence. Then I felt her hand on my forehead and I froze. She began reciting a prayer that involved ""watching over me"". I squeezed my eyes tighter. The prayer went on for a good two minutes. Finally, I felt her pull back and begin to walk out of the room. But before she did she turned back and said ""I hope when you have fully matured you rid yourself of such nonsense beliefs. For your own benefit."" 

I wanted to scream, curse, yell after her that I was 29 years old and didn't need a damn lecture from her. I wanted to notify the hospital board and complain about the religious trickery that had occurred in my room. Instead I willed myself to fall asleep. A few hours later I was discharged out of the ER. 

Never in my life have I felt so violated. It would have been one thing if she had entered the room, introduced herself, and told me the reason she was there. Then, of course I could have politely declined. Instead she invaded my privacy, tricked me in to listening to her, and caused me to believe she was part of the hospital staff who was there to bring me bad news. 

I cannot comprehend the thought process behind this practice. How she herself could play with someone's mind like that, and why in the world a hospital would allow it.  "

""Buy an ad. It'll pay for a new developer to help keep Reddit up longer"" or something to that effect...

10217,385,"The newly formed [Los Angeles Seddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngelesSeddit/) arranged a little meetup at Boulevard 3 in Hollywood last night at a USC/UCLA/Caltech party. I got there right when the doors opened so I had all sorts of time and space to myself, especially since the line exploded and the others were waiting over an hour to get in.

So I'm cruising around and I feel some AA start to kick in. It doesn't seem to matter much though, since for some reason girls are opening me. A brunette and her blonde friend walk up behind me while I'm in line at the bar and declares ""Hi!"" The directness of her approach catches me off guard and I'm a little shocked, so I try to play it off by asking about the way she put her hair up. She gives some response, then asks what school I go to, I tell her USC. ""Oh, so you're loaded then!"" and she puts her arm around me. I sense where this is going, so I say ""I'm gonna disappoint you here, but being loaded doesn't mean I buy drinks for just anyone who walks up and puts their arm around me."" ""Please,"" she responds, ""we don't need your money! We can buy all our drinks ourselves."" Again, I'm a little caught off guard, so I say something to the effect of ""...yeah, that's what's going to happen."" My problem here is something I keep encountering: I'm trying too hard to ""challenge"" her. Challenging her is an idea I keep hearing over and over, but I think that I'm coming across too much as cocky and arrogant. There seems to be a balance that I'm not striking, especially in this particular scenario, because the girl turns away and goes ""you're kind of a jackass."" I'm naturally a very nice and cooperative person, almost to a fault, so my tendency when meeting girls is to overshoot in the opposite direction. Pretty sure the only way to tend to this is lots and lots of social interaction, and the balance should hopefully come over time.

Anyway, I head to the dance floor, and an asian girl off to the side and I catch eyes. We hold gaze for a second, and she comes over to meet me. I quickly pull her onto the dance floor, and she's getting pretty physical. But when I try to escalate too far, she puts up a barrier. I go in for a kiss and she politely shrugs me off. So I back off, freeze her out a bit, I let her come to me and grab and my arms and clothing. To play it off I take turns with her picking out hot guys and girls on the dance floor that either of us would go for. She's pointing out cute girls, so I tell her we're going to set her up with one. I go tapping on girls shoulders telling them my friend wants to dance, then pulling her over and putting the two of them together. The whole time I'm whispering advice in her ear like ""dance sexy!"" and ""put your arms around her!"" When the two of us are dancing together I also drop little hints like ""Just so you know I've got really high standards in women"" and ""you're going to have to earn me."" Do you guys think this is coming off as alpha or just arrogant? Anyway, she seems into it, but she has to leave because of a biology project she forgot to take care of. As she's leaving she tells me to have a good time, and I say that the best moments of your life are the ones you remember forever, what am I going to remember you by? Then we kiss, and I send her on her way.

Shortly thereafter, withClass arrives and I meet up with him and Cptncrnch. Class and I begin making the rounds now that more people are here, and man, what a difference having a wing makes! Earlier when I was on my own, I was there just to meet people, so when I wasn't meeting people I wasn't having fun. Now that I was hanging out with someone I really enjoyed, I was having fun all the time. The (awesome) corollary of that is that the more fun you're having, the more willing you are to go up to new people. From then on I had no fear at all about approaching women since I knew that if we got blown off, I'd have a friend there to laugh about it with. We opened a few sets and tried to pull some girls onto the dance floor, but didn't have much success. Part of it comes down to the fact that I just don't care much for the kinds of girls who go to these big club events, so a relatively small number seemed to share my energy. But like I said, I had no worries whatsoever because I was having a great time in general. I told one girl that her dress looked like a watermelon exploded on it, and told another bullshit facts like how asparagus grows six feet high in Alaska. Just enjoying myself. Having Class around was fantastic and I can't wait to go out again, especially to work on day game and situations other than clubs.

I think [LA Seddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngelesSeddit/) has a lot of potential, I'd love to see guys getting each other going out and having fun. If you've never been out with someone else who wants to improve their game, it's a must. Class and I will be setting up new events soon, and I'd love to hear from anyone with ideas, thoughts, or suggestions for meetups. I'd love to meet as many of you as I can!"

First of all, what this is not:

* A support of torture.

* A support of human rights abuses.

* A support of discrimination, racism, xenophobia, totalitarianism, right-wing indoctrination, or the TSA.

With that out of the way, here is my take on the United States' so-called War on Terror.

The War on Terror is a clever manipulation of shameful human nature, channelled into upholding the common good. It is not a war meant to be won, but rather, a continuous leveraging of the military-industrial complex which has nearly been perfected.

Humans are aggressive, nationalistic, violent creatures. They often see the world as divided between 'good' and 'evil'. As a result, they are easily united behind armed conflict against 'the bad guys'; however, how many people do you know who give a fuck about whatever it is the Peace Corps does? Peace is boring. War sells. And yet, I think, they can be equivalent: in other words, **war is peace**.

First, let's take a look at what the War on Terror has accomplished, superficially:

* Marginalisation of the Taliban.

* Toppling of a merciless dictator.

* Effective eradication of what was once the pseudo-organisation known as al-Qaeda.

* Establishment of liberal, democratic regimes abroad.

I'm not denying that mistakes have been made, that atrocities have been committed, that lives have been lost, or even that a lot of people hate us; military employment entails great risk, and sometimes hands over to unworthy people great responsibility. However, can we not agree that the stated objectives and accomplishments of this endeavour serve in the long run the benefit of both our species and of the majority of innocent people directly in its wake?

Now, America standing up for what's right and defeating the bad guy (i.e. promoting her imperialist interests abroad) may be well and good, but what I see there, and what I suspect the architects of the War see there, is simply a means to an end.

This, in reality, is what the War on Terror has accomplished, and what the War on Terror continues to accomplish in the name of the Common Good™:

* Stimulation of aggregate demand in the economy most central to global productivity.

* Rapid infrastructural development in third-world nations.

* A renaissance of defence-funded technological and scientific innovation.

* Opening doors to both employment and education which may not otherwise have been available for many young men and women.

* And yes, even an acceleration of radical revolutionary processes against repressive states which may have otherwise taken centuries.

In addition, and this is merely conjecture, I honestly believe that continuous military campaign throughout the world (a global police force, that is) may succeed where diplomatic means such as appeasement, the League of Nations, and the United Nations have been shown to fail: relative global peace and stability.  
*As long as the War on Terror can be maintained, I question the probability of another large scale total war among the human race.*

Maybe, one day, we'll be able to evolve past such brutal antics. Orwell and Ike are certainly rolling in their graves, but for now, I'm okay with that. "

R/trainme is place where people that need help achieving their fitness goals can get personalized help that is tailored to their needs.

**Who runs r/trainme?**

R/trainme was started by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ezejo/rfitness_im_in_a_mood_to_give_back_to_the_reddit/) thread.  It was initially just going to be a single good deed until we realizes their was more interest in the idea than we originally thought.  R/trainme is run by every day normal redditors that want to help people that are in a slump with their fitness levels.


**I need help with my fitness level, how do I get started on r/trainme?**

**Simple!  Make your own blog!**  To give some accountability to this exercise (har har), all of us faux-personal trainers will be asking the trainees (you) to subscribe, make a post there, and keep it as a blog. For example, I'd set up something like ""zahrada's Amazing Fitness and Diet Journal"".  Then I'd post there everyday with my diet, any exercise I did, and how I felt (see example below). If you've seen any daily nutrition blogs, you know what I'm talking about. Then my trainer would go on there and post recommendations or general comments.

**What I need from you:**

A little bit about yourself! What do you like to do? Where are you from?

Your height, weight, estimated body fat percentage, and anything that you deem important for me to know. 

Your fitness and nutrition history would be very helpful.

Any nutritional or fitness-related things that I have to take into consideration (i.e. problem foods, gym accessibility, food budget, etc.).

Your one-month, three-month, and one-year goals. Make it specific and as detailed as you'd like. For example, I want to be able to deadlift 450 by next month, have 7% body fat with increased muscle in three months, and have a lifting total of 1100 by this time next year. Those are good, concrete goals to have. ""Look good in a swimsuit"" is not a good goal.

**What will the trainers expect?** I personally, will expect a post every day from you (minus off days).  I feel this is necessary in making sure that you are getting the most out of your time in the gym and in the kitchen.  This post should outline your workout for the day, exactly what you ate that day, and if you want, a personal message for the day (see example below).  And when I say exactly I frickin' mean it.  If you put ketchup on your steak, I wanna know how much.  If you drank a glass of milk, I wanna know that too.  That way, when we see things that we think can possibly be improved, we can identify those areas and act on them!  

**An example of a daily blog post would look like this.**

*JoeBlowRedditor*:  I felt like a one legged cat tryin' to bury turds on a frozen pond in the gym today, but I got through it and did my leg day blah blah blah blah blah .........

My workout tonight went like this:

Quad extensions: 3 sets of 10 reps at 100 lbs

Hamstrings curls: 3 sets of 10 at 50 lbs (could only get 9 on the last set)

Seated calf raises:  3 sets of 15 at 110 lbs

Then I did 20 minutes of HIIT cardio on the exercise bike.

My diet was this:

8am:  3 egg whites, 1 TBSP of olive oil to cook eggs, 2 pieces of toast, 1 TBSP natural peanut butter

11am:  2 cups of fat free yogurt, 10 almonds, blah blah blah

2pm:  1 bucket of rusty nails, a rubber boot, blah blah blah

I'm sure you get the idea.

**Remember that the trainers are here on our own time to help you out** - I want to make sure that you'll respect that and try your darndest to make sure I'm not chasing you around. You can tell me if you don't like or feel uncomfortable doing something - don't just stop replying to me because it's the easy way out.

**Once you get your blog up at /r/trainme, I can get started building a personalized plan for you!**

One more thing:  Be sure to take before and after pics!!!!

If you have any further questions you may post them here.  Likewise, if you are a person looking for some fitness guidance, post here and one of our trainers will most likely take you under their wing.

I've borrowed money (not a lot, but at the moment I can not return it) from a girl I recently learned to know. She is one of the most kind-hearted, nicest and warmest persons I've ever known, and she expects me to return her the money tomorrow, however, I do not have it. Additionally, I lied in the past few days about having it available and being able to return it to her tomorrow out of fear of confessing that I don't, which is actually probably an even bigger issue than the current problem or rather which is what lead to the current situation.

Essentially, I am afraid that this will break our friendship which has only started and I don't want to lose her as a friend.

I don't know what to do, what to tell her. If I tell her I lied about it all along she'll probably hate me on the spot, and I also don't want to make up another excuse for not being able to return it.

I went around to the side of the bar and peed behind a bush, but in my drunkedness I didn't notice the bar was right across the street from the district court and a pair of cops saw me.

They almost arrested me but I talked my way out of it and was issued a ticket for indecent exposure, littering, et al. Luckily my school offers free legal counsel for full time students and was instructed to plead not guilty at my arraignment to get a hearing where my lawyer would show up. At my arraignment there was half a dozen other guys my age (22 at the time) and every single one pleaded guilty to similar offenses (urinating in public, streaking, etc.) And each one was required to register on the sex offender list, and the streaking guy even had some jail time tacked on as well (30 days maybe, I foret.)

11014,604,"I've never known how to ask this question, but I attempt it occasionally nonetheless.

Early music, especially Bach, though downright prissy by modern standards, was fucking awesome. I know zilch about musicology (and have never been able to learn), but it seems that he made these vastly complex-but-sparse structures, akin to legendary code, the writing of Johnson, or beautifully-designed tools. 

Look at the Unaccompanied Cello Suites, ferinstance. Even though it's a single instrument playing a highly minimal sequence of notes, the pieces are anything but simplistic. It's as though... as though he's doing counterpoint *down the timeline*, rather than across separate parts, if that even means anything to anyone. There seems to be a high degree of interrelation; if you grabbed both ends and pulled, it wouldn't just unravel.

Contrast and compare with Romantic and later composers, who despite adding vast quantities of sound and fury... seem to signify far less. Mozart, for example. Lots of pretty themes and variations and leitmotifs and whatnot, all just bundled together arbitrarily, with no apparent overarching design and a whole lot of redundancy. If you snipped a bit out or transposed two sections, it likely wouldn't break anything. 

Can someone *please* tell me what I'm trying to describe, here? 

Is it something to do with re-using identical sequences in different contexts to different effects? Simultaneous sequences with high-common-multiple lengths, to keep them out of synch and thus provide repetition-but-not? Self-similarity, such that the structure of the whole resembles the structure of the parts? 

I lack the vocabulary and knowledge to express or reason about this in the domain of musicology. Can someone, if they have *any* clue what I'm grasping at here, explain it some abstract or analogous terms? 

Also, I notice that rock/pop/techno/metal/etc utterly lack this quality of 'elegance'; is it even possible to transplant the aesthetic into other genres? Could one create something with the testosterone of death metal or hardcore techno, but the brain-imploding *smarts* of early music? (by which, no, I don't mean playing Pachelbel on the electric guitar...)

The closest I've come to such would be System of a Down, who were clever little fuckers underneath all the screaming. "

5882,508,"There is no reason behind evolution. It is simply the description we have applied to what happens to living creatures over a large period of time. We have evolved incredibly complex minds with amazing faculties and abilities. Thus, introducing foreign substances into our brains (which is what we do when we take drugs) can fuck up the whole system. That is to say, our normal brain chemistry becomes fucked, and we experience things as they were not meant to be experienced.

Often, this is a bad thing. Alcohol, for example, can bring your exaggerate your emotions and bring them to the forefront, often with terrible results. But the thing you need to remember is the first thing I said in this post: There is no reason behind evolution. Therefore, there can be no absolutely true values. We evolved the way we did by mere coincidence; there is no moral or logical reason why a sober mind should be considered *better* than a mind under the influence.

So **here's the thing about drugs.** By definition, drugs alter your state of mind, and so it is obvious that this is often a bad thing, because our minds work pretty well to begin with. At the same time, though, there is nothing to say our minds are pristine or perfect; there is no reason to suggest that a drug could not improve our state of mind. The thing is, our brains are so advanced that you're hard pressed to find a drug that will make the brain work better than it already does. Most drugs (even if we enjoy them) follow this rule. But some drugs – cannabis and psilocybin come to mind – actually make the brain work in ways that, while impractical, can be very useful and entertaining.

The moral of the story: Drugs fuck with your brain. They alter your perception and the way you process those perceptions. Because our brains are so complex, 9 drugs out of 10 really just make us more stupid. But some drugs, by sheer chance, fuck with our brain chemistry in such a way that we are able to experience reality in a more awesome way. Because evolution is completely devoid of any values (the creatures that succeed are the ones that can fuck the most, not the ones who are most morally virtuous), there can be no rational argument that suggests drugs are immoral or completely incapable of being advantageous.

10456,396,"My favorite thought-piece about Ferris Bueller is the “Fight Club” theory, in which Ferris Bueller, the person, is just a figment of Cameron’s imagination, like Tyler Durden, and Sloane is the girl Cameron secretly loves.

One day while he’s lying sick in bed, Cameron lets “Ferris” steal his father’s car and take the day off, and as Cameron wanders around the city, all of his interactions with Ferris and Sloane, and all the impossible hijinks, are all just played out in his head. This is part of the reason why the “three” characters can see so much of Chicago in less than one day — Cameron is alone, just imagining it all.

It isn’t until he destroys the front of the car in a fugue state does he finally get a grip and decide to confront his father, after which he imagines a final, impossible escape for Ferris and a storybook happy ending for Sloane (”He’s gonna marry me!”), the girl that Cameron knows he can never have.

Girl 1 is your idea of a perfect girl. Everything you could ever want in a girl packaged into 1, completely devoted to you. The perfect wife. All of this minus one thing; she has slept with many, many guys. To the point that she lost count. Possibly 50+. She's clean, and would never cheat but she did get around before she met you.

Girl 2 is a virgin. She is just a beautiful as girl 1 but is extremely average. She wouldn't be a bad wife, but she would pale in comparison to girl 1. She wouldn't be nearly as interesting, and the sex would be very average. She would still be a stable wife.

So which one would you wife? Why would you pick the girl you did? Would the tradeoff of virginity be that big of a trait to miss out on a perfect wife?

But then I wonder if I could ever be that happy-- if any possible situation could result in me feeling like I wish I felt when I was a kid. Even if I become accomplished and surrounded by friends, can I ever be satisfied? 

I feel like I am living my whole life waiting for a switch to flip so that I can turn into a person who is self-validated and self-actualized and that as long as I keep living I am approaching that. Even when I accomplish something, I am never satisfied. I'm not even sure anymore that it is possible for humans to be satisfied. When we are done we are left as unfulfilled as when we started. 

Sorry if this is a bit of a downer, but I have been thinking about this for a couple of days and I feel like articulating it will help me move past it a little bit.

9357,18,"My gf took out student loans to go to a private college. She's from an immigrant family, and the 1st among them to go to college. She realizes now that she should have gone to a less expensive school.

With a semester or so to go before graduation, she made the mistake of taking summer courses. She didn't realize summer semester could not be paid via student loans. 

She owes the school about $8,500 for her summer classes. The school quickly sent the bill to collections. She cannot re-enroll *or even get a copy of her transcript* until it's paid in full (or settled for a slightly lower amount).  So far, she's only made a couple payments of $150, though they insist on larger payments.

Her mom (dad is out of the picture) has never been able to offer financial support in the past, but recently gave her $3,000 towards this issue.

She was going to send the 3 grand to the collections agency, but I suggested she hold off until we establish a plan. Unfortunately, she let collections know that she was going to send a big sum, so they started salivating.

When I suggested she negotiate with them, they remained very inflexible about the terms of repayment: Either $1450/month, or send $3,000 now and make subsequent payments of $250/month (this would be very difficult for her to maintain considering how little she makes).

They're threatening her with wage garnishment (she works her butt off making $10/hour for an animal hospital). I'm not particularly worried about that, but she needs to finish school so she can get on with her life.

She is stressed about this, and gets frequent collection calls. I suggested that she send collections a ""no further contact"" letter, and proceed to make payments as best she can.

**Finally, a few questions:**

* Instead of giving the $3,000 in a lump sum, would it be more advantageous to give it in payments of about $300? That would seem to buy her time, even though collections isn't receptive to receiving these ""small"" payments. My worry is that the school will off-load the debt to another party, and she won't be allowed to return. (The current collection agency is directly contracted by the school, and for now her debt is still with the school).
    
* We are writing a letter to the school, but I don't really know on what grounds we can ask for forgiveness, assistance, or get her re-instated as a student. Any suggestions?
   
* Is there any grounds for her to challenge the schools policy of not releasing transcripts for unresolved accounts? At least then she could work towards her diploma at a community college.

She just wants to get this ordeal over with so she can get on with her life.

3714,66,"As Internet is becoming a best resource to run a online business and earn lot of money through online Internet activities, I have seen many people getting diverted towards reseller hosting business. The main reason behind this is 'Reseller Hosting business can be started without having any deep technical knowledge of command over support services. Many web hosting companies have a big amount of bandwidth available but the ground level customer is not in need of such a large amount of bandwidth for their tiny websites. In this situation a Reseller Host who works as a middle agent between web hosting company and webmasters plays a crucial role by purchasing high bandwidth and distributing it in small among as required by small webmasters.    We will find many web hosting companies encouraging the Reseller hosting business as they want their business to grow in remuneration of a tiny part of profit on sales of direct deals without webmasters. As the technical support staff of a web hosting company is highly expertise in handling the technical issues regarding hosting, a Reseller does not need to play any role regarding actual hosting operations. One of the part of this technical knowledge is that many people are not aware of the the difference between Linux Reseller Hosting and Windows Reseller Hosting and hence the get confused while selecting one of these two.    In Reseller web hosting the reseller can use and given disk space and bandwidth as he required. It is up to him how much he want to sell to the third party customer's web hosting  services at higher rates than the rate at which he has purchased it from a web hosting company and how much to keep for his own Website Hosting. As there are main two type of web hosting 'Windows Hosting and Linux hosting', both are used very widely in Reseller hosting also. If we compared these both then we will find that Linux reseller hosting is more often chosen by Reseller and the reason behind it is absence of Incensing fee which is charged by Microsoft windows. Linux is a open source and easily down-loadable for free of cost. One more advantage Linux has over windows is that it is very reliable for various scrips of very popular languages like My-SQL, Perl and PHP. It can handle large databases without any problem and with as equal security as a Windows server provides.    Now we will look at some strengths of Windows reseller hosting which does not comes with Linux Reseller hosting. Windows platform is known of highly supporting to ASP scripts which are Microsoft's very popular application for designing websites. The RDMS which comes under SQL is responsible for highest level of reliability can be managed with Windows Reseller hosting. Furthermore just using a single cPanel a Windows Reseller can manage many clients which is hardly possible for a Linux Reseller, and this causes making Windows Reseller hosting more time saving and effortless. Microsoft's SQL servers are better for managing critical business application.    Both Linux Reseller Hosting and Windows Reseller Hosting has their own advantageous and disadvantages. It is up to ones mind to know his own needs and comfort and choose one of these. The people who are just starting up their websites or businesses with a tight budget are more likely to go with Linux Hosting and Big and well established businesses who want to implement .NET or Microsoft applications can go for Windows hosting.

* Sore throat (daggers when I swallow my own spit)

3444,640,"Hi.  So my 2007 Pentium iMac did a goofy thing out of the blue a while back.  I believe this occurred after restarting the computer then letting it sleep at the log in screen (my wife and I each have an account).  When I go to use the iMac instead of my name (oldnintendood) and her name it just had one log in as oldnintendood (2) next to it.  Didn't open with any passwords I knew.  

So I called Mac Help they said they did not know how the log in names can be changed, but I should put a disc in, re-install OS, then do all software updates, then do a time machine restore.  

I did, all was fine until last night, I know this time I had just done a software ""install and restart"".  Then computer restarted with that olnintendood (2) as the only log in name, can't get into computer.

I am right now just doing a Time Machine restore from earlier this week.  Not the whole reinstall of OS first.

First thing I am gonna do is check system preferences and Look for that second log in.  Delete it, and make sure mine and my wifes is good.

Oddly, I remember seeing somewhere either on my desktop or in a finder window, or folder the oldnintendood Computer (2).  I looked for it last time but never found it.  As I think, I recall it may have been once you click on the Mac HD icon.  I will investigate that more, Im not sure.

Here are two weird issues I also have noticed.  My setting is always keep Hard drive and display on.  I habitually sleep it when I am done, never leaving it.  Most time I shut down.  Once this issue started, when I start the re-install OS it would start to dim the screen and then sleep.  I never changed this setting ever, even after re-checking the preferences before starting a time machine, it would dim screen and try to sleep.  I let it sleep on accident once it crashed the install OS and restore time machine.

Ive also had time machine start from the OS install disc, get 20 minutes into the time machine restore then go to a gray screen and give me an error and option of restarting the restore (which brings me back to the main option page of the OS install disc) or just shut down.

TL;DR  twice now my iMac changed user log ins to a copy (oldnintendood Computer (2)) with a pass word I dont know.  Mac gave me the re-install answer, but now it has happened again.  Please help!

EDIT: Restore went 100% all logged in correctly.  Did NOT find in systems preferences Accounts, and Name oldnintendood's Computer (2).  

INTERESTING, went to spotlight (right after logging back in after Restore) and it said Indexing oldninstendoods Computer (2)...  what does that mean?

2473,56,"Just a little background:
Moved into my apartment, only to find that the neighbors above me have a 60lb pit bull that runs around like crazy.  Though our complex is pet friendly, I think they bought it after moving in, since I don't think the managers would allow a pet of that size.

The dog runs around like crazy upstairs, and the noise is way above what would be considered normal apartment residence living standards.  I've called the managers at least 20 times in the last year to tell them the situation, and they've even come in to hear it themselves.  But it hasn't stopped.  In fact, the only actual thing that was done was to reduce my rent by a month as a sort of ""put up with it"" consolation.  Further, I feel that these people are really white trash, and it would be a waste of time to go and bitch to them about it.  

How can I resolve this situation?

TL;DR Noisy dog/white trash neighbors upstairs, apartment managers not taking major action on the situation. Really fucking annoying."

If everyone can be on around that time, it would be great to advance through off-season recruiting and other steps in one night.  If we can't all coordinate, then we'll just go through each step as soon as everyone can get to it.  

Please remember to set your Ready To Advance flags throughout the off-season process so I can advance as soon as everyone is ready.  Also be thinking about your out-of-conference schedule so I can set that up for you in the pre-season.  

If we can get everyone on, the off-season process will take about 2-3 hours depending on how long it takes everyone to recruit, cut players, do position swaps, etc.

8432,387,"I actually got it because I heard it was so bad and wanted to watch it with Rifftrax. But I honestly found myself just laughing at the film itself even more. As a forewarning I never saw the show so there isn't any sort of fanboy nit picking of the film in this regard.

Lets start off with why this shouldn't be called The Last Airbender, and rather The Continuingly Illogical Decisions of the Fire Nation. I say this because a majority of the story and the dialog is actually focused on the villains. Hell Asiff Mandvi has more actual lines of dialog than the titular character. While I can kind of understand shying away from giving a child actor lines, Shamalan did the 6th Sense, which probably has one of the best child performance of the past 20 years. Also they end up replacing bits where obvious dialog could help you understand Ang with these idiotic reaction shots of Ang just looking confused, constipated, or like he dropped him ice cream. 

Next there is no hint of an actual attempt to direct this film. Take one scene for example where we have Ang fighting in a courtyard of the Earth village, then suddenly he is running down an alleyway then it cuts back to being in the courtyard again. I mean this is beyond some slight goof that is only slightly noticeable. I honestly thought the video I had skipped or something. To me it sort of felt like he had some fight scene planned but it was completely unfinished. 

This takes me to how the film is blatantly and painfully unfinished. It is pretty obvious that they had a broader story they wanted to tell but due to whatever restrictions they had to cut parts out. For instance we are told certain crucial plot points. There is narration in the film just to say why they are in some random location and why the character is acting a certain way. For instance we have the scene where they rescue Ang in the ice land. Before this Ang was all confused about who he was and was a blank slate. Within 2 seconds he suddenly has all of his memory back and is happy to be playing with his pet monkey back home. Okay so like 2 seconds ago he was being kidnapped for reasons he can't understand, and now he doesn't even question this at all, and instead he takes the people who let him get kidnapped to his home. Blatantly there needed to be a scene where he remembered stuff or actually talked to the other characters a bit more, but they just forgot or didn't have the time or didn't care. You know maybe I just missed the part where they explain that Ang has downs syndrome or is some sort of autistic savant.  

Another thing on not being completed is the ending that just blatantly forgets to wrap up any plot line. So doing the whole shitty sequel teaser thing aside, this is the worst ending in film history. So we have the fire guy with the messed up face that the film has focused half the film on. The last we see he just walks away before the big final moment. What the fuck is he doing after that? He can't go back home, will he get thrown in jail as an enemy combatant, will the moronic protagonist forgive him for trying to murder all of them? Oh yeah then 4 guys just team up and brutally drown Asif Mandvi to death because you know it's a kids film, even though it has clearly been stated before that they could have restrained him with ice. But hey at least that wrapped up a single plot line. Then what about the girl with the white hair, is she dead? I mean I guess she is supposed to be we don't see her at the end. 

This also takes me to one thing that has pissed me off with narration as of late. Narration can be used in three ways: Book ends (beginning and end narration), all throughout, and as an introduction (worst of the acceptable types). What so many modern films have done lately is what this film did criminally, is just use narration to gloss over important plot lines then gets completely abandoned halfway through the film. The ending to this movie would have been a perfect time to use narration to wrap up some of those plot points in a quick and precise manner. But instead we just get the ""fuck it we are done"" approach. 

My final point in how this is the worst film of all time is the Room and Troll 2 didn't have a $150 million budget and thousands of people working on it. Everything done in this film was just utter shit. The sets look like Christmas playsets, costuming all very trite and ugly, CGI laughable. Hell one of the worst offenders I think should be casting. Why is everyone white or Indian in a movie based on a show where everyone looks like eastern Asians. I mean, fuck, someone was having to sign all those checks and approve all those shitty Shamalan ideas. Just fuck this movie, kill it with fire, and do the same is Shamalan.

I have been told the best mix is to use a 30% potassium hydroxide solution but I have also seen conflicting 20% recommendations. I was thinking of cutting it right down the middle to 25% nothing should go wrong correct?

also I understand that this type of battery has significant gassing. I was wondering if when battery levels get low do you replace only the water? or do you also have to add more of the potassium hydroxide...in other words is some of the potassium hydroxide lost in the gassing process?

This is probably the last time in my life I'll have that opportunity. Nobody is depending on me. I have no commitment to school or a job. So am I crazy? Or maybe just stupid? Will that ""year off"" come back to bite me when I start applying for jobs again?"

My dad has spent the past few decades of his life reading through all of Spurgeon's sermons (the entire 63 volume set- it fills his whole office!) As a result, he is a wealth of information on what Spurgeon believed about every doctrinal matter known to man- as well as who Spurgeon was and very intimate details of his life. Just putting that out there to see if you would want him to do an AMA.

**EDIT: If this gets up to 25 votes I'll ask him. He's a busy guy, so I want to make sure when I bring it up to him there's enough interest.**

**EDIT #2:** If you don't know who Spurgeon is/was, check out ye olde wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spurgeon Spurgeon is considered one of the most influential Christian preachers in the past few centuries- especially revered by protestants and baptists- but certainly he was a man that had an influence on many different aspects of life in subsequent generations. So even many non-Christians see his contributions to the world and English literature as noteworthy.

**Edit 3:** ok definitely enough people want to ask him questions. Going to call him in a bit to let him know.

-------------------

**Final Edit:** Ok I talked to him and he agreed. On Saturday (the 29th), he's coming over to my place and I'm going to help him out (I'll probably be typing and transcribing his answers). This will probably be around noon CST. Stay tuned!"

About a year ago I got into an argument with about 3 friends who watch/love Stephen Colbert and his show.
Anyways we were watching the Colbert Report and I said something along the lines of it being a great satire of a Democrat pretending to be a hardcore republican. They all stared at me blankly.
""I'm pretty sure he's a republican..."" one said ""Yeah he's definitely a republican. Where did you get that idea from?"" the other said. The debate got even more heated from there as I tried to defend my point.
Now I personally am conservative and I knew from the first week of watching his show that it was a satire. He clearly makes subtle jokes poking fun at republicans to which the audience irrupts in laughter.

I logged into their account and much to my excitement there was an applicant the very first day. You may ask how I remember it was Ted Williams? Because the cover letter started professional and jovial; I was excited because he had experience. But His cover letter slowly evolved into a weird incoherent tirade on how clear channel was blind to his ""special powers"" and wouldn't take a chance on him but if they did the hr person would be rich and famous, but  because he was homeless and was banned from the library they were discriminating against him. The next week everyday someone named ""special powers"" kept applying and insulting the channel mostly in all caps with increasing anger and profanity.

I traveled a good distance back to my ""spawn base"" and on the way I saw a few strange things.  The leaves of the trees all around the area of the spawn base had changed color.  Not just one color as if it were a different biome but the trees have leaf blocks from all the biomes.  It actually looks kind of cool but I don't think it was intended.

The other strange thing I saw was the shadows in a mineshaft didn't work like they did before.  I have a hole to bedrock that is almost exactly like the one Coe builds at the start of Coe's Quest.  It has the glass platforms in it for the sunlight and everything.  Well at certain parts of the hole there were incredibly dark shadows on the walls of the shaft as if there wasn't light reaching those areas (but yet somehow reached squares a few blocks lower than them).

9885,151,"I realize that this is coming out of the blue but if we decide to go with a single storyline instead of the dual one here's and idea that I had last night.  I was working with the idea of a secret game and what we could do with it.

Either way I think we need to nail the outline by Monday and would propose to have a brainstorming session over the weekend with whoever wants to be involved.  I'll send out the contact list for the people I have so far this afternoon.

So here goes my idea for what it is worth:

The Ultimate Game  - Basic Concept

What is the Ultimate Game?

Anti-game protests and flyers alert students to the possibility of some secret game going on.  Website links will lead them to a group of scientist working on some kind of game across major universities ranging from India, China to of course the United States.

Players who manage to find out more about the game will eventually be brought to some kind of sign-up page but as they try to join the game will receive a bizarre entry question and be kicked out if they don’t answer it right.  As soon as the first question is solved another one appears (new level of entry).  After the third one is cracked the players will receive a welcoming message “Welcome, to the game. Play it well and you will grow.”  

Eventually players will realize that they are not playing against human opponents but computers.  Strangely there seems to be a moral lesson associated with each game.  

As they play someone seems to hack into their computers and interfere with their attempts to win.  They might even receive threats telling them to stop playing the game.

By solving the increasingly challenging puzzles and winning some of the games players will uncover the goal of “The Game”.  It is to use games to teach computers to be more “human”.   The scientists are working on breaking the barrier between humans and computers and they believe that this can be done by teaching computers how to play games.  The need to play games and have “fun” while using one’s intelligence and creativity is a fundamental human trait that computers are still missing.  By teaching them first the basic concepts of games and then have them play more and more realistic simulations they believe that computers will learn new puzzle solving skills but also about collaboration and team-work and the idea of having “fun”.  But some people are concerned about the convergence of AI and humans and foresee a Terminator-like future with omnipotent computers.   The scientists’s argument is that the goal of the game is the exact opposite.  By teaching the computers to be more human they will also become more compassionate.  A computer who has learned the value of life will be less likely to launch a nuclear missile to destroy a city.  But then Hitler and Stalin were humans too and they were looking for world domination so will teaching computers to be more humans really prevent a future disaster?  So the debate rages on.  

The anti-game league started attacking the computers linked to the game to end the experiment.  By playing the game the players have also become a target which explains the strange things that has happened to them.  Note:  the anti-game league could potentially not be aware that they are also targeting ""humans"" since they are mainly trying to have the computers stop playing the game adn are not aware that humans are playing it too which ads a new level of danger.  

But just as the players finally uncover the purpose of the game and who is behing it they realize that there seems to be a third group involved in the game.  It’s a group of anarchists infuriated by the actions taken against wikileaks as they see this as an attack against free speech.  They are trying to use “The Game” for their own purposes.  They managed to hack into the game to insert an “Ultimate Game” that supersedes them all.  But what is The Ultimate Game?  It is to hack into the Pentagon and other government agencies all over the world to bring them down.  The group is using the network of incredibly smart computers all over the world already solving the most challenging puzzles to do this by disguising their attacks as a game.  The ultimate game is already running and it is only a question of time until the computers win it unless the game is stopped.   But the ultimate game is hidden so deep within the other games that it is hard to detect.  It is up to the players to find a way to do so and stop the computers from completing it by retrieving damaging information about various governments that could then be released by the anarchist group.  


The solution could be to potentially change the goals of the game or convince the computers to “lose the game” in people’s best interest.

11091,15,"I have hypothyroidism, which is supposedly under control. And asthma, for which I use a fast acting inhaler twice a day. I'm 25, 5'8"", and weigh about 120 lbs (I'm underweight). I spend way too much time in front of the computer, but I eat *fairly* healthy now.

I occasionally get anxiety attacks, which started happening a few years ago. I first noticed it when going to see movies in theaters, then it slowly got worse. Now, they're pretty rare, but they still occur randomly (most often at night).

The main problem I've been having, though, is that I feel shaky/hungry quite often. Diabetes runs in my family, so my endocrinologist had me do a blood glucose test. She determined that I'm *not* diabetic, but I'm borderline. She told me to eat better, eliminate sugar, and get more exercise. She also said that my thyroid medication may be causing anxiety because my dosage is on the high side, so she lowered it.

I'll be honest, I haven't really improved my exercise habits, but I have been eating better -- the only sugar I have is natural things like fruit. But this shakiness/hunger/low blood sugar feeling hasn't really gone away. I'll eat a big meal and then a couple hours later I'll feel very hungry again. I've even tested my blood sugar level when I felt this way and I think it was pretty normal (once it was 72 and another time 94).

I went to a regular doctor and he said that some of this might be psychological and that my inhaler (albuterol) might be contributing. He prescribed a steroid inhaler (flovent) which I haven't been able to afford yet and said I should have at least one session with a psychologist.

To me, it feels like the problem is something physical. Maybe exercise is the key (it's the one thing I haven't really tried yet -- and I'm pretty out of shape). I just wish I had some definite answers on what's wrong with me. I keep worrying that it could be something terrible.

Appreciate advice and suggestions. I just want to feel normal again."

2072,125,"In the majority of lobbies I've been in, I've noticed that **at least** 65% of players are just camping it up and hiding in buildings so that they can work up their killstreaks. And that's a very ***conservative*** estimate. In some games, it feels as if 90% of my time is spent trying to get guys out of their hiding places. In FFA, it's even worse: it's as if 6/9 players are hiding in rooms, sitting in obscure corners and lying prone in random places. The amount of killcams that I've watched where the guy is just sitting there taking in the scenery is rage-inducing. To make things worse, they have a vast selection of defensive-minded equipment to help protect them:

1. Motion Sensor: Should I really need to have Hacker Pro to go undetected by this? And if I switch to Hacker Pro (leaving Ninja Pro out), how do I know that he doesn't have a headset or have his volume cranked up, thereby allowing him to hear my footsteps? And doesn't this piece of equipment force me to put away rusher perks such as Ninja Pro and Marathon? In MW2, the heartbeat monitor was countered by the Ninja perk (no pro perk needed) and it could only be aimed in one direction. It was also a gun attachment, which turned a lot of people off it because it meant that they couldn't equip a silencer or an optical lens. 

2. Claymores explode the second you walk into them. In all previous games, there was a time limit, which meant that if you were rocking Marathon and Lightweight, you could rush right past them if you played your cards right and the claymore wasn't perfectly aligned. Or you could jump, and if you got the timing dead on, you could you barely escape death. It feels as if the only way to counter claymores in Black Ops is to equip Hacker and flash bangs. The thing is, you only have two flash bangs and if you're playing a game such as FFA, those things will be used up pretty quickly. If I'm trying to clear multiple campers out of multiple buildings, I'm not going to have flash bangs on me at all times. And if I'm wanting to play aggressively, I can't. Why? Because I'm being forced to use Hacker as a perk, which means that Marathon and Ninja are out the door.

3. Then you have Jammers and Camera Spikes, which aren't used as much as the two pieces listed above.

In WMD, people camp in the main middle building, the roof by Dom flag A, the building that gives you access to the bridge above Dom flag B, the building overlooking Dom flag C and the tankers.

In Hanoi, there is **always** somebody looking out of a window! You have the two buildings by the C flag. A building with two windows at the far end. The building with the invincible shield around its balcony. And of course, that main building in the middle. 

I could go on about other maps, but I think I've made my point (Havana alone would turn this post into a novel).

I have footage of one guy sitting in the same corner for about 90% of the game (see my file share ""Camp of Duty""). I have another clip of [this guy here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCh3oBqwsto) ADS'ing the doorway (seriously, notice how quiet that game was?). I come across so many instances of out-and-out ADS camping, that I could spend the rest of my life uploading clips of other people sitting in corners. They equip Ghost, a silencer, a motion sensor/claymore and then hole themselves up in a room. It's so bad that the majority of them don't even bother to use the balcony or window associated with the room. Instead, they choose to ADS the doorway so that they can blast anyone who comes through.

I mentioned this before and many people told me that I was just over-reacting. Well, I am now absolutely certain that I wasn't over-reacting. "

It seems relatively easy, you find when x=0 what is y. But when I do that I get (0 - 0) / (0 - 0) which is 0/0. The y-intercept is 1, and that doesn't work.

= 2(x² - 4) / (x² - 9)

y-intercept is when x=0

Uno già conclamato, l’altro lo sarebbe stato in futuro, questi sono i fatti, ha destato molta sorpresa, molta emozione il fatto di vedere entrare un parlamentare in carica nel carcere di Rebibbia perché a memoria d’uomo negli ultimi anni, pure gli decenni si era visto qualcosa del genere soltanto a proposito di Previti che andò a Rebibbia a scontare i 7,5 anni delle sue due condanne per corruzione giudiziaria, caso Mondadori e Caso Mills ma poi, grazie all’indulto e grazie a una lettera che si era fatta fare da Berlusconi la ex Cirielli trascorse solo 3 comuni di quei 7 anni e mezzo in carcere, mentre il resto andò a farlo prima ai domiciliari e poi addirittura in affidamento al servizio sociale, cioè in assoluta libertà. 
Cuffaro invece ha un problema rispetto a Previti, la condanna è più o meno uguale, Previti 7,5 anni, Cuffaro 7 ma il reato per via dell’Art. 7, dell’aggravamento mafiosa non è soggetto a indulto e quindi non c’è lo sconto dei 3 anni e quindi Cuffaro non può sperare che scenda il totale a 4 anni, che poi con vari benefici etc., rapidamente scenderebbe a 3, a quella soglia sotto la quale si possono scontare le condanne in affidamento al servizio sociale e quindi i primi 4 dei 7 anni, se non cambieranno le leggi, li sconterà in carcere, carriera ovviamente finita, tanto più che nei prossimi giorni dovrebbe arrivare dal Gup del Tribunale di Palermo, l’altra sentenza per l’altro processo che la Procura gli ha intentato per concorso esterno in associazione mafiosa, per avere proprio non fatto dei favoreggiamenti così episodici, ma per essere stato proprio stabilmente come politico al servizio di Cosa Nostra. 
E il suo vecchio maestro Mannino non gli ha fatto un gran favore ieri quando in un’intervista a un quotidiano, ha ricordato come si incazzò moltissimo quando Cuffaro andò a chiedere i voti per lui, per Mannino a Angelo Siino che era il rappresentante della mafia nel tavolino degli appalti e che quindi ovviamente gestiva un sacco di voti.

5086,133,"So, I manage a used media store. About a half hour ago I received a call from one of my employees telling me that a customer had called the store requesting to speak with a manager. She left her phone number, and because I like resolving issues quickly, I called her back immediately. The way she handled herself was stunning.

She answered and I introduced myself. She told me that she purchased a game from my store that was marked at $34.99, but upon leaving, noticed a price sticker from a competitor that was left on the box which read $9.99. She felt like she was being overcharged and that we were ripping her off. I explained that while the competitor's price sticker should have been taken off, both stickers were clearly visible and only one of them was actually from our store. She then asked me how I would feel if I went to the grocery and a price sticker from another store was on an item I bought. I told her that I would assume a price sticker from a different store was incorrect and not applicable.

I remained calm the entire time and tried explaining why with older games from systems that are no longer in circulation, you might see prices go up over the years, but she wasn't having it. Every time I tried to speak about the situation, she would begin shouting over me and threaten to go to the attorney general with a complaint if I didn't give her her money back. Now, here is where the issue is.

Our company doesn't do cash back returns; only in store credit. It's written and explained very clearly at the bottom of every receipt. I told her that in rare circumstances, this can be worked with and exceptions can be made, but because of the way she handled herself and treated me while I was attempting to resolve the issue, I would not be offering this type of resolution.

I never lost my cool, and I feel like I was very respectful toward her despite the way she yelled at me for 10 minutes. In the end, however, she told me that she is contacting our corporate offices and the attorney general. I was hoping by explaining the reasoning behind not giving into her threats and vicious nature, she might in the future handle herself better and treat the people she is dealing with in a more respectful way. Unfortunately, I think she will miss the point and simply run around flailing her arms and screaming about how she was wronged. All the while, she will continue to be absolutely oblivious to the fact that had she treated me with the respect I granted her, she would have gotten her money back and there would be no problem to speak of.

So, do you think it is worth standing your ground on issues like this? Or is it better to simply give in to the demands of unreasonable people when they refuse to look from anyone's perspective but their own?

tldr; Angry customer is denied her way. Good?"

I will create a site regardless of the answer because I know my father is passionate about this project and it's some good bonding time with him. I just want to get user input!

Thanks!"

8943,116,"Let me start this by saying this is not a plea for money. I am looking to help my friend with contacts, friends, leads on jobs etc. 

3 years ago my friend Alex was caught trafficking over 5 pounds of  cannabis from California to Virginia. Growing up in CA, i don't think he really understood the scope of the crime he was committing in Virginia. He was hit with 28 years for an aggravated felony. His friends, family, and former employers wrote to the judge asking for leniency. Because Alex had no record and they could show he is a real stand up guy, the judge dropped it to the 3 year federal minimum. 

Alex served his 3 years in prison in Virginia and was set to be released Jan. 18th 2011. He found out while he was in prison that because he was born in the UK he would be picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and moved to a jail until he can get a court date. At that hearing he will be deported to the UK.

So here are the details that i know so far. 

* At some point in the next couple of months he will be called up. 
* He is not going to protest the deportation. 
* He will be escorted in handcuffs from DC to London where upon landing the marshals will un-cuff him and he will be free.  

Alex has not lived in the UK since he was a toddler and knows nobody there. He will be traveling with only a small carry on and no money. We are working on a plan to get somebody there to meet him and get him to a hotel. 

I do not have the money to go myself, but I'm putting all my personal shit on hold to try and save what i can. I don't really know what to do but i thought maybe reddit would be able to connect him with some hook-ups. Anything would help. He needs to start over. At 38 he needs a job, new clothes, a phone, net access, a place to live but maybe most important, some people to take him out and show him around his new home and share a beer. 

I met Alex in San Fransisco in the mid '90's. He lived with 5 of my friends on Fulton &amp; Baker and i was over on Hayes.  He was all about hiking, camping, playing guitar, riding his motorcycle and walking his dog. He was never a criminal, always sweet and kind to everyone, clean cut and polite. 

There is a website with his contact info here: [friendsofalex.com](http://friendsofalex.com/)

9621,97,"13 марта 2011 года исполняется ровно 100 лет известному философу, гуманисту Лафайету Рону Хаббарду. Хотя Л. Рон Хаббард наиболее известен как основатель Дианетики и Саентологии, этим его деятельность далеко не исчерпывается. Сама жизнь его была необычайно разнообразна, и влияние — многосторонне.

Рон Хаббард  как-то сказал, что достаточно задать два вопроса, чтобы узнать, хорошо ли человек прожил жизнь: «Сделал ли он то, что намеревался сделать?», и «Принесла ли его жизнь радость людям?». Ответом на первый вопрос служит огромный труд, который проделал Л. Рон Хаббард за свою жизнь, в том числе более 5000 печатных работ и 3000 лекций по Дианетике и Саентологии, записанных на магнитную ленту. На второй вопрос могут положительно ответить десятки миллионов людей, жизнь которых стала намного лучше лишь потому, что Рон жил на земле.  

В  один месяц вместе с Роном Хаббардом  родились также такие известные люди как;
Альберт Эйнштейн (1879 г.), Игорь Кио (1944 г.), Юрий Гагарин (1934 г.), Михаил Горбачёв (1931 г.), Лайза Минелли (1946 г.).

6485,428,"What can I get for this price?  I need a small cheap combo that will sound half way decent, but can't afford much more than this right now."
6158,186,"OK firstly lets clear a few facts:

ELO Hell may exist in so far as players are shit &lt;1200 and down into the 900 realm BUT this is not ""ELO Hell"". This is Low ELO.

ELO Hell is the 1100-1300 range. Why? I'll explain.

All players start at 1200 ELO. This means that every level 30 with his 100 wins and his 10 champions, 3 of which he can play, will be here. These are canonically the worst players in the game. These are the guys who go 0/5 in 10 minutes and go full tilt, raging and feeding for the rest of the game. This is not their fault. They are used to a climate of ignorance AKA normal games. They have enjoyed an easy ride so far cruising through Low ELO pubs. Now they face the real challenges of this game which lie in ranked. I was guilty of this. I played with a bunch of level 30's from 15 up. These guys were better than me by a huge margin but through a larger interest in this game and its mechanics etc. by the time I was level 30 I was raping them in any inhouses etc. So I thought I was Hot-shit. I fed a load of ranked games as sub-optimal picks and dropped to 900 ELO. Ouch.

Now the aforementioned players exist in every game between 1100-1300 ELO. And statistically you will get them in around 50% of your games. These guys WILL fuck up your team wether by picking master Yi even though you need a tank and already have 2 AD carries. These are the guys who tell you they cant buy wards because they need their 3rd phantom dancer and of course: Feed. So having any more than 1 of these players (and often you get more) WILL cause you to lose.You may get lucky and avoid them for 3 games but until you rise out of that ELO bracket you will NEVER escape them. Over time this gives you a 50% chance to win games. 

So as you can see Wining/Losing 50:50 means your rating never changes. This is being ""Stuck"" elo hell. This doesn't neccesarily mean you are a godlike player. Think of each player as a % of your team. An average player will be 20%. A good player may be 30%. A bad player might only be 10%. If you consistently play well then when you have a bad game you might pull off amazing ganks, buy tons of wards, save teammates and get dragons. The baddie who becomes your 5% will be made up for by your godlike 35% play! If your whole team plays well then you might be 20%. This means that you will rise. However playing this will will not be within the capabilities of 1200/1300/1400 or even 1500 players. Thus the vast majority of games in ELO hell are decided by which team gets the most ""Scrubs"".

I don't claim to be a top player. If I could realistically place myself I'd say high 1300's low 1400's. But I am stuck at 12xx ELO for a while now. The ragers/abusive players actually make it harder to play than the losses. In the next week or so I'll post some videos I plan to record of my Solo ranked games to document this phenomen.

8442,709,"I wrote this for my friend who is on his mission, but I spent a lot of time and heart in this post and I figured I should at least share to all who wants to read. 

Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

This one doesn't really make a whole lot of sense in the context of a monotheistic religion. If you believe there's only one God, then how can you have other gods? But, when you think about it, Mormonism is a polytheistic religion. As man is God once was, as God is man may become, right? That implies that there are other Gods out there. 

Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water underneath the earth.  Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God is a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.

I never really understood this commandment when I was a believer. Ironically, it was only after I left that i did. No images of anything in heaven (That includes God) or in the earth beneath (Hell?). That seems straight forward. The 2nd part is a bit more disconcerning and one that I'm assuming Mormons gloss over since it directly contradicts their beliefs. Here we have a jealous God (I kind of assumed that a perfect being wouldn't be jealous, but I guess I was wrong. I'm jealous that God's allowed to be jealous but I'm not) who will punish children for the crap their fathers did, unto the third and fourth generation. That's grandchild and great-grandchild being punished for something they didn't even have a say in. What a just and loving God. I guess the 2nd article of faith that states man will be punished for their own sins should have an asterisks next to it. 
Not only is this commandment completely useless to us today, it's taking the place that could be used for a better commandment, like no slaves (Or why not have that be the 11th commandment. Do we have to keep these to 10?) It's odd that, for a God who places so much emphasis on agency (Remember the different plans in the pre-mortal?) he doesn't say anything about forced servitude. It certainly would've stopped the Israelites from claiming all the virgin women of their conquests for themselves. 

Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 

God is like Voldemort...uh, I mean, He who must not be named. My problem with this is that, in addition to being a bit petty (this could've been replaced with a better commandment), it states that God will not hold them guiltless. Seems like people can't be forgiven of this sin (Is it really THAT bad?). Oh well, it's God's word and God is law. Oops, I think I said God one too many times. I guess I can't be forgiven. 

Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.

The biggest question in my mind is which day is that? Old Testament Jews took Saturday (makes sense. 7th day is Saturday) and they were never corrected by God. But in Acts we see the apostles take off Sunday. Hmm, is it Saturday or Sunday? It can't move because in Genesis we see that God blessed that day and made it Holy, unless you can move Holy Days around on a whim. Oh and Paul states that one day in God's time is 1000 years in our time, so God really blessed an entire 1000 year period...yeah...

Honor thy father and thy mother.

This is a really good commandment, most of the time. There are a few exceptions where one or both parents are just so inept that they don't really deserve any honor at all. Examples are abound in the news, so I won't go into details.

Thou shalt not kill.

When I first wrote this down, I wrote murder but I double checked Exodus 20 and it does say kill (at least it does in my LDS Scriptures App for my ipod. I'm sure a few other bibles have murder instead, but I'm sticking with LDS canon). This commandment is damning not only in terms of heinous sins, this one's number 1 or 2 on the list (which is odd that it's the 6th commandment and not the 1st or 2nd) but also in that it's the first commandment that God gives man that he himself has not kept. Just think of how many men, women and children died in the flood, much less from all the cursing God did (the first born of the Egyptians were killed. Why? Because Pharoh didn't let the Israelites go. Nice to see God attacking the root of the problem). In LDS canon, there's this idea of Justice. We needed a savior because without it, justice would demand that we pay for our sins, to hold us accountable. Well then who is holding God accountable for this? 
Not only did God not keep it but neither did Moses for after he came down from Sinai, he commanded that every man should kill their brothers for their iniquity. Not to mention the subsequent conquests they had along their journey to the Promised Land.

Thou shalt not commit adultery.

I had to look this up in the dictionary, just to make sure. Adultery is sexual intercouse between one married person and another person (who may be married or unmarried). God is ok (or was originally ok) with two unmarried people having sex. Of course, the revised 10 commandments given later to Moses stated that sexual intercourse was for marriage only and railed against gays saying ""A man shalt not lie with another man"". However, nothing was said about female on female. God is definitely a dude.

Of course then we have Jesus who comes along and states that any man who lusts after a woman has committed adultery in his heart (nothing on homosexuality, though. Paul would be the one condemning that in the New Testament). This conflicts with current LDs canon in that these feelings were put into by God, they're good but only within the context of marriage. Kissing, hugging, showing affection, that's all fine now but Jesus says otherwise so we must ask ourselves who is right? And, if it's Jesus, then why would God endow human beings with such sexual feelings only to condemn us for having them outside of marriage?  

Thou shalt not steal.

This is a good commandment though the ransackingof the Canaanites and taking the land they were on might constitute stealing. But since God owns all the land originally, I guess he's just relocating his belongings, though this leaves open the possibility that taking something is ok just as long as God dictates that you can.

Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

The only commandment I can't improve on. Kudos God. I'm interpreting this one as lying in a court of law. If it's meant to never lie, well, God has problems with that, as do we all. Sometime's lying is ok (Of course you're pretty, Honey) when it's done for the greater good (No Jews in here Nazi S.S. Officer).

Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbour's.

1st problem is quite obvious, it considers the woman (wife, maidservant) to be a possession much like a house or animals or anything else that a person owns (try telling that to any female, lets see how long it takes her to beat you up).
2nd problem is that this is the only commandment that punishes thought. All the other commandments had an action to them, honor, kill, adultery, steal, here you're not forbidden to do anything, you're forbidden to think of something.  Again, like I said before with adultery, this is a feeling you're born with, if not even more so than adultery. A baby wants food, milk that isn't theirs. Toddlers wants toys and covets the toys of their peers. This is not something you're taught, it's in humanities nature, something that must have been put there by God otherwise how else would it exist? Why would a benevolent being give someone a poison only to critisize them for getting sick?"

2668,626,"Hi All,

It sucks that it worked out this way, but I started this subreddit just before a time when I would be focusing much more on everyday reality and less on ET contact. Part of this is due to the cold Winter season, and when it gets warm I will hopefully be going out with a group and seeing if we can make something happen while continuing my own intentional contact.

What will we need? Well, a high definition video camera would obviously be helpful, especially one with a night vision setting. I am planning on doing some research on good cameras for nighttime UFO capture and seeing if I can afford one. The other equipment we need are lasers &amp; high-powered flashlights for back and forth signaling, and even some camping gear if we decide to spend the night under the stars. I have a radar detector which some ET groups like to use to show their presence (Dr. Greer has had alot of success with this). 

For anyone who has studied the contact phenomenon, any other suggestions for gear that might be helpful are welcome, and anyone in Texas or surrounding states who would be interested in meeting up is more than welcome. If you have gear to contribute, even better!"

**What to do:** Look at Reddit normally. Now look at it from a different angle. 45 degrees should work fine (any direction). The alien logo should pop up as a tiled background.

6025,308,"Hi guys,

I've just had my first weak ""clean"" and I've notice when going to the gym, I'm REALLY exhausted during and after, I just can't keep up with what I was doing before now.

I assume the drop in carbs is to blame, does anyone have suggestions on how to improve the situation?"
9560,201,Are you among the young people who suffer acne? Looking for a way to permanently get rid of this infection? Then you will surely be interested in tips about teenage acne treatment in this article. 
1872,377,"A couple of good X-mas items of interest: I've got an extra Brass Beast &amp; Amputator. I can also craft the Buffalo Steak Sandwich if need be.

Also looking for the Spy, Scout &amp; Soldier polycount hats in that order. I've got a Pyromancer's mask + a whole bunch of weapons (I can craft them to metal if you want), paint, nametags, description tags &amp; dueling minigames for trade to one of those if anyone's willing.

Also have lots of crates (series 3-5, 8,9)."
10435,114,"I have a soundcloud, last.fm, disrupt.fm, cllct, tumblr, bandcamp, myspace, etc, but I can never seem to get anyone to actually get to those pages once I have made them. I know that playing live would do wonders for that, but that really isn't an option right now. 

What can I do to promote myself?"
2652,484,"In ZvP I always go for 14 gas 14 pool speedling expand, but I feel like in small maps, it's better to go roaches rather than speedlings because the huge mobility will not be used as much.  Any good BO out there at diamond level?"
1287,292,"I don't want to take an ounce away from the generosity that has gone toward helping Ted out.  It's heartwarming and amazing.

However, I can't help but be slightly bothered by something:

There are tens of thousands if not millions of people just as genuine and in need as Ted, but not born with something like a fantastic voice that is their lottery ticket out of homelessness.

Helping Ted out is, to a certain extent, sort of like only saving a cute kid from a burning orphanage.

I'm happy to see the generosity, and I understand that the fact that there's something unique about this man is what sparked interest, etc.  I just think we also need to display the same sort of care and generosity toward people who don't have such an amazing gift or talent.  It's easy to feel like ""cool, we just did something!"" -- and you did.  You did help by spreading the story!  

I just don't think it should stop there, and I wish that it didn't take something like an entertainment talent to make someone as lucky as Ted was.

I hope that everyone who was this generous considers that we also ought to help people who are just... normal but struggling?

Again, I don't mean to disparage the outpouring of support in the least bit - it's fantastic to see.  I just wish that this sort of thing could also happen to someone who is, for lack of any nicer way to put it, not blessed with a talent/gift like this... someone more... I dunno... mundane but equally in need..."
1016,577,"Il secondo appuntamento a Siena è previsto il giorno dell’Epifania, il 6 gennaio alle 17.30, al Teatro dei Rozzi per il tradizionale concerto di musica lirica.

Protagonisti il soprano Cristina Ferri, la russa Maya Dashuk, il tenore Giorgio Casciarri, il baritono Brian Nickel e il basso Paolo Pecchioli.

Il programma prevede l’esecuzione di classici della lirica come Bizet, Puccini, Bellini, Donizetti, Rossini, Verdi, Leoncavallo, Lehàr, Massanet, ma anche canzoni di Gastaldon e Lara, accompagnate al pianoforte dal Maestro Simone Marziali, collaboratore del Festival di Torre del Lago. Inoltre, ad arricchire la loro presenza scenica, ci sarà la partecipazione della scuola di danza di Irene Stracciati, le cui coreografie impreziosiranno i pezzi tratti da “La Vedova allegra”."

I never really thought I felt better with anything and I usually just gained weight. As I was going through college I found myself joining many others by taking some adderall to do some last minute studying. The drug is amazing and I felt it gave me a strong will to be motivated in life. It far exceeded any drug I was prescribed for bi-polar.

So my question is this, should I even take Adderall if I am diagnosed as bi-polar or would it be okay if I asked my doctor for it? I am somewhat scared to ask for it because I thinks he will suggest I take other drugs or question my history with it."

I thought it would be a good opportunity to try this out for the first time. So I apporached two girls in the foyer who were sitting down on their own. I opened with ""Hi, can I ask you your opinion on something?"" Blah Blah, ""Do you think this tie makes my friend look gay?"" We continued from there (holding individual conversation with one of the two girls) but this guy bailed and left me with the two girls. 

I carried on talking and within 10 minutes I was snogging one of them. I thought I had done well... Then she asked about buying her a drink. I did the whole ""Why should I buy you a drink I hardly know you."" thing... She went over to the bar and ordered 3 drinks. Whilst we were waiting she asked for my number which I gave, then before I know it I was stood there on my own and the barmaid was asking for £9 for the three drinks (two of which had dissappeared). 

I was pretty pissed, but shit happens. Any advice?

3641,424," Our Yearly  Dementia Test 


It's  that time of year for us to take our annual senior citizen  test. 

Exercise of the brain is as important as exercise of  the muscles. As we grow older, it's  important to keep mentally alert. If you don't use it, you lose  it!   Below  is a very private way to gauge how your memory compares to the  last test. Some  may think it is too easy but the ones with memory problems may have  difficulty.   Take  the test presented here to determine if you're losing it or  not.   The  spaces below are so you don't see the answers until you've made your  answer.   OK,  relax, clear your mind and begin.

* Question 1


1.  What do you put in a toaster? 


 
  

Answer:  'bread.' If you said 'toast' give up now and do something  else.. 
Try not to hurt yourself.    If  you said, bread, go to 





* Question 2.
 

2.  Say  'silk' five times. Now spell 'silk.' What do cows drink? 
 
  
  
Answer:  Cows drink water. If you said 'milk,' don't attempt the next  question. Your brain is over-stressed and may even overheat. Content  yourself with reading a more appropriate literature such as Auto  World.   However,  if you said 'water', proceed to

* Question 4. 



4.   It's  twenty years ago, and a plane is flying at 20,000 feet over Germany    (If  you will recall, Germany at the time was politically divided into   West  Germany and East Germany ). Anyway,  during the flight, two engines fail. The  pilot, realizing that the last remaining engine is also failing,   decides  on a crash landing procedure. Unfortunately  the engine fails before he can do so and  the plane fatally crashes smack in the middle of 'no man's land'   between  East Germany and West Germany ... Where  would you bury the survivors?      East  Germany, West Germany ,   Or  no man's land'? 
   


 
  
Answer:  You don't bury survivors. 



If you said ANYTHING else, you're  a dunce and you must stop. 
If  you said, 'You don't bury survivors', proceed to the 



next  question. 



*  5.  Without using a calculator -  


You are driving a bus from London to  Milford Haven  in Wales .    In  London , 17 people  get on the bus.
In Reading , 6 people  get off the bus and 9 people  get on.
In  Swindon , 2 people  get off and 4 get  on.
In Cardiff , 11 people  get off and 16 people  get on.
In Swansea , 3 people  get off and 5 people  get on.
In Carmathen, 6 people  get off and 3 get  on.
You then arrive at Milford Haven . 
Without  scrolling back to review, how old is the bus  driver?  
 
 

Answer:  Oh, for crying out loud! 
Don't you remember your own  age?    It  was YOU driving the bus!!

PS:  95% of people fail most of the questions!!

Dreamy house that you could really dance to, and yet at the same time you could stand still and just drift away to. I don't know if i'm not looking properly anymore. Maybe it's my fault. Maybe i got too sucked into dubstep. But dubstep has never been able to fill that void. It's a very stimulating genre of music, but rarely provides me with the euphoria that house used to.

10038,346,"Hi guys.

So thesacred, reseddit and I went out sarging last night. [TokyoSeddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoSeddit/) needs to represent, you know!

I just want to comment on one particularly unique set. 

The reason this set was unique was because it was HUMONGOUS and the total life of the party.

reseddit and I are in a local Japanese pub (izakaya), having beers. Across the room from us are two tables packed to the brim with party people like sardines. The main table looks to be maybe a 10 or 12-set, half of which are cute girls.

Needless to say, we want to find out who they are. From across the room it sounds like they are speaking English too, which means they're probably cool.

Behind that huge set is another huge set (maybe 6 or 7 people, 2 or 3 of which are girls).

reseddit says to me, ""We have to open that set."" We've got our eyes on the prize (the 10 or 12-set).

Before he charges in blindly, I say to him... ""Look, this is an advanced maneuver here. These people are obviously celebrating something and they're not looking particularly open to newcomers. In addition they're all Japanese and you know how Japanese men love to shut foreigners out from their women. We need to come up with a game plan.""

At first I suggest we go talk up one or two of the girls whenever they go to the bathroom. That way we can isolate them and build some rapport.

reseddit shuts me down. He's right, what good is getting to know ONE PERSON in a 12-set gonna do?

I think to myself, ""What would Mystery do?""

Why? Not because he's **TEH GREATEST PUA OF ALL TIME!@1!!12**, but because he's the guy who originally wrote up Advanced Group Theory.

EUREKA! I've got it! Looking at the 6 or 7-set behind the 12-set. If we can win those guys over, we can merge sets and we're in!

reseddit charges in like a boss. I think he opened with something situational ""Hey, can I borrow a lighter for my cigarette? Oh hey, what kind of wine is that you're drinking?"" or something.

Whatever it is, it stuck long enough for him to sit down. One of the set says something about ""leaving your friend alone"" (e.g. me). I dunno if this was a hint to GTFO, but reseddit interpreted it as, ""Hey TofuTofu! Get over here!""

So I come over and sit down like a boss.

And you know what, seddit? For all our anxiousness about this set...

...

...

...

**Everything went better than expected.**

They were really cool, high-status musicians who just finished a huge show that night, hence why they were so in state. A few of them came from NYC, like me, so we bonded over that. It turned out both tables were actually together so we didn't even really need to merge sets.

I got a solid phone number and an invite to their show directly from the main star (a famous vocalist, I guess).

So the moral of the story, seddit? **DON'T JUST SIT THERE! GOOD THINGS HAPPEN WHEN YOU OPEN SETS!**

Try to remember this FR next time you see an intimidating set you want to open. If the two of us can open a TWENTY-SET, I'm sure you can open whatever you're facing. JUST DO IT!"

9569,615,"Hi there,

So here is the situation. How do you find out what is coming up event-wise? Where do you advertise? So far in my music scene life I go to multiple websites to see which shows are coming up including the artist's page, promoter websites, and facebook. Going to the local music shops is also an option as they frequently have flyers posted. As for my experience with promoting we would go out to events and flier cars, post fliers around the city, and post on facebook. 

In our age of technology this seems really tedious, time-consuming, and costly to me. I've been involved with promoting and throwing shows here a little bit. I have a great ear for music, a great eye for aesthetics, am an excellent writer, and am not only good at organization but love to do it. 

So what can I do with this? I figure a local website meant exclusively for the local music scene would be ideal. The thing is, I really want to do this right and so will be paying for actual webspace. So of course I will be charging event coordinators to post their events on my site. My question for you event coordinators and promoters is - How much do you think is a fair and reasonable cost for this for both parties?

More details about the website:

It's meant to be an all-out replacement to the mess of facebook and other networking websites. A single place to go exclusively for electronic music. The main point is an organized place to see what events are coming up without having to sift through facebook. I know I personally don't even check facebook for events anymore it's become absolutely retarded on there

There will be a section with monthly dj interviews/spotlight

There will be a section with photos and reviews of past events

There will be a forum (hopefully with upvote/downvote options to help the fans feel like the scene is their own. it's also a more organized place to discuss the music scene here. Some people have been getting together on nexopia but that world is dying and why not do the same thing on a website that also provides photos, events, and more)

There will be a contact form where you can either subscribe to a monthly calendar or simply to contact myself with offers or requests for the website

There will be a section with videos of past events

I want to integrate ticket sales into the site as well - so events can both be promoted and sold from 1 single place

I would also like to eventually add a page with music recommendations and possibly also track sales for local producers

These last 3 options will be carried once the website gains enough popularity, I'm going to give it 6 months. I have no fear that it won't the scene is big here. 

Big scene I say? Yes I do. We have at least 10 promo companies bringing in djs weekly. There's rarely a night that there isn't a show to go to (which is spectacular as I don't live in that big of a city). The biggest promo company has 13,000 members on facebook

What I am thinking is a 3-tiered system for charging clients. Anyone that wants to post an event for the initial launch can do so for free. Each of these clients would also receive a discounted rate for the next 6 months. Anyone who didn't sign on for the launch can certainly sign on later but would pay the regular rate. At 6 months I would introduce the videos, ticket purchases, and track purchases and would charge everyone the regular rate. 

This rate will be flat for the ad, and the ad/flyer would stay posted until the event is over, at which point it would be moved to our past events page. 

Included in this rate would be an inclusion in the monthly newsletter I will send out to subscribers including a calendar of events that month 

So it looks like this (using letters for values, lower letter is lower value, let's assume the launch date is Feb 1)

Signs on feb 1:

Pays $A (which means free) for the first ad/flier

Pays $B for any ads posted until August 1 

Pays $C for any ads posted after August 1

Signs on after: 

Pays $B for the first ad (unless it's after August 1)

Pays $C for any ads posted thereafter

All Receive:

A posting in the events page with any information they would like included whether that be all their info in text format, a flier, or whatever they would prefer to use. As I do technically have a graphic designer they also have the option of having us make their ad/flier for a fee 

Photos, reviews, and videos of the event posted after

At the 6 months mark the ability to sell their tickets through the site

Inclusion of their ad in the monthly newsletter being sent out

Any clients that post events with the website frequently will also have their logo on the bottom of the website

So what are the lowest and highest amounts you would pay for this?

tl;dr// I am making a website for the local music scene to have an organized place to check out upcoming events. How much should/could I charge to post these events for promo companies?"

4077,447,"Currently with Nevada Federal Credit Union, and I'm kinda tired of their shit. Today, I logged into my account to discover that my ATM deposit availability limit had been reduced from $500 to $100 arbitrarily, and as depositing into an ATM is the only way at most branches to add funds, I'm just done with it. 

Can anyone suggest a better bank, credit union, or prepaid debit card? 

Requirements/Preferences:

* Has to have direct deposit
* Will not allow me to overdraft. If I don't have the money available, decline my transaction. Like the law says you're supposed to. 
* I don't make enough money that I can afford transaction fees, account maintenance fees, withdrawal fees, or any other shit fees so many banks seem to like to charge. I just need a basic, free checking account with a debit card. 

I've tried ING, but because they require a line of credit, I don't qualify. I have an ACE Express card that I have yet to activate because even though the website said it was a free card, with no withdrawal fees etc, the disclosures list a fee for basically everything from looking at my card to memorizing the card number.

2142,239,"Philadelphia, PA, January 07, 2010 -- Are considering a yoga retreat, spiritual retreat or a romantic couples retreat? You have allocated the time and money and are committed to a meaningful experience. How do you know what to expect from your upcoming retreat? A little forethought, research and proper planning can make your retreat a profound life experience a la  Eat, Pray, Love.

A little online research will show that there are terrific retreats all over the globe. The abundance of differing techniques, varied locations and contrasting practices may be a bit overwhelming. Here is a checklist of considerations that might help finalize your choice, according to Jasmine Kaloudis, Yoga Retreat Leader near Philadelphia.

1. Instruction - Just as you know there are many forms of yoga, you also know each variation has a different instructional style. Make sure the teaching style at your retreat is to your liking and within you ability.

2. Goals - Make sure you understand the goals of the yoga retreat you will be engaging and that their goals match well with your personal aspirations. Again, research is the key. When setting your goals, think both long-term benefit and short-term benefit. If the program does not give you a sense of these benefits, speak to a coordinator.

3.  Facility - Get an understanding of the program's facility and how the yoga program utilizes the retreat's facilities. Practical ramifications of this information may affect how you will dress and therefore the clothes you need to pack. Are you looking for something luxurious like Miraval or would something spartan, clean and more budget-friendly like Kripalu serve your needs?

4.  Experience - Cross-reference your own research with the first hand or word-of-mouth experiences of previous attendees. Don't be afraid to ask if they would return or what their progress has been since visiting the retreat. Do a google search for reviews of the retreat or ask if you can speak with someone who experienced the retreat.

5. Travel - Just as you plan your itinerary, make sure there are no holes in your travel plans. Some retreats are in outlying areas. Verify and confirm all return-trip information weeks before departing. Check the weather as well before you are traveling. Investigate the cancellation policy in case of inclement weather.

6.  Budget - Your budget should include all costs associated with travel and the yoga retreat.. Be especially clear about meal and travel provisions. It is safe to say that every yoga retreat has its own standards. Are extras such as spa treatments, mats, blocks and other classes included or are they extra?

7. Experience - Many yoga retreats cater to practitioners of different levels. Some retreats are prone to accept beginning students while others prohibit the beginner. Most important is matching your experience level with the program's stated experience levels. Are you looking to do an intensive program with 6-8 hours of yoga a day or would 2-3 hours be your pace? Find our the schedule before hand if you can.

Probably about £2k.

He seems to be of the opinion a gaming laptop can last four years, I have told him this is totally unlikely an issue exacerbated by the limitations of upgrades.  I'm right.....right?  Ram and HDD maybe but surely chip gphx or mobo upgrades are unlikely?  OR is there a make who make laptops which are more upgrade friendly?

502,21,"Professor Daniel Goddard was upset at his colleagues at the Edward Witten Institute of Quantum Physics for their growing scepticism over the apparent efficacy of his work.

As he drove home from work that Wednesday evening, his jaws clenching over and over again, the strawberry-flavoured gum in his mouth lost all flavour so he tossed it out the window at a stoplight a mile from his home. ""I'm going to get drunk tonight,"" he triumphantly decided. ""I'll call in sick tomorrow. Why the hell not? I deserve a day off from their... their...."" He let his words trail off.

Once home, he poured himself an overly-large tumbler of whiskey and drank it while tossing a few logs into the fireplace. He carefully lit the kindling underneath. Several drinks later, he announced to no one in particular, ""I'm gonna start it up. I'm gonna start it up and fix it once and for all. I'll show those bastards."" He brought his drink to the basement, fumbling with a couple of light switches along the way.

Illuminated by a bare swinging bulb hanging from the ceiling, knocked carelessly by his bobbing head, stood a tall machine of some sort. It was attached, by thick cables, to several smaller machines at the edges of the cramp room. ""There you are, my beauty,"" he growled lustfully. The sound of rolling thunder outside the basement window muffled his slurred words. Placing his half-empty glass upon a nearby workbench, he methodically began turning on switches and levers. The room began to fill with a low humming sound, various twinklings of coloured lights. The humming grew to a throbbing whine.

The only window in the basement drummed sporadically under heavy raindrops. A peal of thunder cut through the growing din of the thrumming machine. Daniel Goddard smiled crookedly. ""Are you ready, baby? Here we go!""

He slammed a large lever forward. The basement window suddenly flashed from a nearby lightening strike."

All of this while some dude in a suit is taking a dump in the next stall over. Got the inspiration from the elevator scene in ""Ghost"".

10760,205,"Hey guys,

What is your opinion on the ""RPG Lite"" route that Bioware took with Mass Effect 2? Mass Effect 1 had deeper RPG mechanics (Stats were a lot more in depth, level design resembled dungeons as opposed to linear level design in ME2, experience points accumulated after each kill instead of being compiled after the mission, much more exploration). 


While ME1 was heavier on the RPG elements ME2 concentrated more on the combat. It was noticeably improved over the first game. That being said what is your opinion on the route that Bioware went with Mass Effect 2?


I personally favored ME1 RPG elements more compared to ME2's heavier shooter elements. I felt that the level design in ME2 was left to be desired because it was just so damn linear. It's obvious that Bioware put all their effort into making the combat more exciting in ME2 but what I don't get is why they went with such a linear design. Maybe they didn't have enough time on their hands to add multiple paths through the levels. I enjoy running around a level exploring every little room for the extra gear to improve my character. I love losing myself in the worlds that Bioware has created andI hate running down hallways to the next door only to be led down another hallway. 

Another minor annoyance of mine was the addition of a ""Mission Accomplished"" screen. I prefer getting my experience after each enemy I kill like most RPGs. It did serve as a great summary to further explain what happened but I feel this should be moved to the journal or codex (where you could separate each mission and read what happened). 

What was also missing from ME2 that I enjoyed in ME1 was vehicle exploration. I know a lot of people hated the Mako (I loved it personally) I felt that Bioware should've taken the time to add it into the game properly. The hammerhead is fine but the way Bioware implemented it (until Overlord) was horrible. The Hammerhead missions didn't do vehicle exploration justice until Overlord came a long, and even then you didn't have much to explore. I miss landing on uncharted planets and EXPLORING, it made Mass Effect seem so much more real. 

One last feature that I wish Bioware would have added was the ability to equip all of your squad mates with armor. It was pretty cool that they made it so you could customize the shit out of Shepard but what about my squad? I thought they at least would've given us the option to equip different armor to our squad mates. 

**TLDR**; I hope that bioware brings back more RPG elements for ME3. Not so linear design as seen in ME2, vehicle exploration, experience per kill instead of a total mission experience, and the ability to equip your squad mates with different armors. I realize that shooter fans favor the ME2 system over ME1 but I hope that bioware can find the happy medium. **OH YEAH, AND BRING BACK THE DAMNED NORMANDY MUSIC, IT WAS AWKWARD RUNNING AROUND A SHIP WITH NO MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND!**

9471,313,"So let's say that you can't only choose between two girls to marry:

Girl 1 is your idea of a perfect girl. Everything you could ever want in a girl packaged into 1, completely devoted to you. The perfect wife. All of this minus one thing; she has slept with many, many guys. To the point that she lost count. She's clean, and would never cheat but she did get around before she met you.

Girl 2 is a virgin. She is just a beautiful as girl 1 but is extremely average. She wouldn't be a bad wife, but she would pale in comparison to girl 1. She wouldn't be nearly as interesting, and the sex would be very average. She would still be a stable wife.

10778,303,"Leviathan was a fire-breathing sea dragon that, according to God, really, *really* existed.

Yahweh made Leviathan to frolic in the ocean.

Psalm 104:26 - There the ships go to and fro,
   and Leviathan, which you formed to frolic there. 

As to the characteristics of this creature which Yahweh, really, *really* ""formed""/made/created:

Job 41 -
18 Its snorting throws out flashes of light;
   its eyes are like the rays of dawn.
19 Flames stream from its mouth;
   sparks of fire shoot out.
20 Smoke pours from its nostrils
   as from a boiling pot over burning reeds.
21 Its breath sets coals ablaze,
   and flames dart from its mouth. 

Also, Leviathan had multiple heads, something like Medusa.

Psalm 74 -
14 It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan
   and gave it as food to the creatures of the desert. 

But, apparently, Leviathan is some sort of immortal vampire-like (or maybe Frankensteinian) creature because, even though Yahweh already killed Leviathan once (Psalm 74) he is planning to kill him again when Jesus returns.

Isaiah 27

Deliverance of Israel
 
1 In that day,

   the LORD will punish with his sword—
   his fierce, great and powerful sword—
Leviathan the gliding serpent,
   Leviathan the coiling serpent;
he will slay the monster of the sea.

But *as soon* as the EMT guys walked into the door, he **flips** out and ran all over the house looking for an exit, bolting left and right and knocking all my shit all over the place. 

So I think he's just scared 'cause of three strangers with a giant (to him anyway) metal construct (the gurney) and left the balcony door open so he can get back inside (it's winter and minor snow storm tonight) while I was at the hospital. 

Fast forward about 7 hours and I just got back home an hour ago. My brother and dad got home and neither of them noticed the cat being gone (they thought he was just sleeping in his closet, he does that a lot now that he got fixed). But I looked all over and nothing. Now this next part is weird.

He was outside, in a couch we threw out (he was inside). He's been  in there since we left as far as I can tell. When I lifted the couch up to check he bolted back into the house, and hiding under mom's bed, in the pantry etc until we blocked off all exits and hiding spots. 

At this moment he's just sitting there in the kitchen, knowing there's not space left to hide. He doesn't hiss or whatever, he lets us pet him and brush him. He meows like he did when we first brought him home from the vet.

Here is the overall situation.  My credit is absolutely terrible, and I am in the beginnings of rebuilding it.  One good option for me of course is a cell phone plan.  Now, currently my credit is so atrocious that I can't get a regular plan with any of the major carriers except T-Mobile with their FlexPay plan.

Essentially it is a pre-paid account that if you pay on time for 6 months you can switch to a normal cell phone plan that does report to the credit bureaus.  

Now, I do need a smart phone for work (I'm in IT and need normal access to the internet and applications away from a computer).  Yes, I can get an Android through Virgin Mobile with a much cheaper plan than what I would get through T-Mobile, however I would be paying much more up front for the phone on essentially a pre-paid phone with no credit reporting.


So this is where I need feedback.  Do I go with T-Mobile, get a cheaper Android phone than I would with Virgin but with a higher service charge each month., and work my way to a reporting credit line, or do I look at other options for credit enhancement, via the more expensive Virgin phone with the cheaper plan ?"

He also mentioned that he has lived all over Europe, but never mentioned where he was from. The list of countries lived in was quite vast, but i assumed he was originally from Canada. The other day he mentioned that he was from Transylvania. I was immediately curious as to why he would name a province, rather than his actual country of origin.
Then it hit me...
This guy is a Roma, who is now living in Canada, but still won't admit his heritage. Does anyone else here feel that there has to be something wrong with our society, when a man crosses the world, to a new continent, but is still scared to admit his heritage. 
I casually asked if he was Roma, planning on still treating him as a friend, letting him know that he's accepted here. He started stuttering, and wouldn't give me a straight answer, and now he refuses to talk to me. 
I just can't believe it. It's 2011, yet somebody still has to be scared to admit where they're from. I think something needs to change. Soon.

Here are the details:

We are all in our mid-20s and we've been making films together for about five years now. We live in Los Angeles and have started Finite Films in a bid to increase our professional profile and seek out would-be supporters, fans, and producers. We've erected a page on a website called indiegogo.com hoping to make a small amount of money for future projects. We're not expecting anything substantial for a long time--we know it will be a hard path and that we have to work from the ground up, but we think it's a really fun idea.

If it works out the way we hope it will, people will submit narrative constraints that we will have to mold our next film (one every month) around. We let the internet community create and vote on the ten constraints we will have in our next film (such as ""one character has to explode at some point during the film,"" or ""a Hasidic Jew has to fall in love with a Palestinian,"" etc.).

If anyone feels like dropping us a line, suggesting a narrative constraint, or (if you happen to be a self-made billionaire with nothing better to spend your money on) donating a little bit of pocket change to help us fund our next project, we would be eternally grateful. Like, genetically-recreate-dinosaurs, train-them, and-give-them-to-you-as-personal-pets grateful. Seriously. We have the scientific capability.
Watch our short video explaining our project, and if nothing else, thank you for your time!

Edit: I hope that I have submitted this to the proper reddit. If I haven't please let me know and I will remedy the situation. Thank you!

5121,150,"Friends,
Those that have listened to my radio shows might have remembered me commenting many times on the fact that when it came to attacks we have experienced in the past: ""we haven't seen anything yet"".
 
The bored, petty bloggers and various hatefilled individuals who have wasted their time creating anti-z/anti-peter joseph sites and videos are about to be royally trumped by a mainstream media onslaught that will bring the definition of attack/propaganda into a whole new light.
 
I have been contacted by CNN, NBC, FOX, ABC, AP, Yahoo! and many national/local/international news agencies regarding the comment by Zack Osler referencing a TWO YEAR OLD association of my first film and Jared Loughner. The parroting of this painfully unscientific and idiotic association has resonated across all mainstream outlets. As of now, I am not engaging them for I want the new film to be released before anything.
 
After the film is released, I have a feeling we are going to see a huge backlash. The stage has been set... and I want all members to hold strong. Don't let any of this get to you. This is exactly what I have been expecting with regard to the media introduction of TZM and it is long overdue. If it wasn't the AZ shootings it would have been another scapegoat. Just as Wikileaks is now associated with a ""rapist""- the Z films and hence the Movement/myself are going to be publicly pegged to ""mass murder"". This is how the game works and I plan to do a radio show on the history of propaganda in the near future to discuss this historical phenomenon.
 
After the release, I am going to established a large PR campaign for all press interactions from the Movement and TZM is going to explode with interest.

6952,364,"Before I even bother asking the whole reddit community, I need to know if it's stupid that I even ask such a daunting request.

To summarize- I have been a redditor for over 2 years and have contributed a great deal to the community. I am a moderator of r/chicago, r/design, r/art, and the new r/crappydesign. Last week alone, I submitted two pics that got a combined total of half a million views. I say all that to sort of establish that I'm not a fly by night or someone unknown to the reddit community.

My problem is that my wife had an affair on me last year and left taking the kids. We live in the Chicago area. She let me see the kids every weekend for a month while she lived an hour away. Then one night I got an email that said she was in florida with my kids (1 year old and 3 years old). I had no choice but to file for divorce and emergency return of the kids. The judge granted it and she returned 2 weeks later in dramatic fashion with a 3 police escort (despite no threat of violence).

The lawyer I had to hire to get this done has a reputation in Chicago as being the best father's rights attorney. This was my first lawyer ever so I didn't know what to expect. I had to borrow the $3,500 retainer from my parents to secure their services.

Subsequent to her return, my wife somehow secured a lawyer (she pawned off our wedding rings as well as our wii and some other posessions). I told her I would drop the divorce so we could go to counseling, but she said she would just refile. My hands were tied.

She began filing stuff against me- for example an order or protection for frivolous things like text messages taken out of context and an attempt I made to access her email while I was suspicious of the affair (even though she successfully accessed my email herself). So the lawyer hours begin to build up.

I got my first bill from my lawyer for $7,000 about a month and a half in. I was flabbergasted. I didn't know where I'd come up with the money. The next bill came soon for a total of $12,000. I realized I needed to stop the bleeding and drop my lawyer. This game was too expensive to play. I make $65,000 a year- take home $48,000ish and most months am able to make around $1,000 in side income. So my take home is probably around $60,000. Might sound like a lot to a single person, but my rent is $1,050/month for a fairly humble 2 bedroom townhouse in the Chicago suburbs with a 1 car garage and washer/dryer in unit. $7,000 was probably a manageable debt...$12,000 was very much out of hand. The bleeding had to stop.

So I told my lawyer I had to drop them. The process of dropping them took weeks because there were still motions being filed and whatnot. I wasn't able to drop them until Dec. 31st (they were in my employ for 3 months). I got my final bill recently. $20,000. Add to that the $3,500 I owe my parents and the $500 I owe my kids lawyer and I'm sitting around $24,000 in debt. Almost half of a year's take home pay.

In the midst of all of this- my wife makes criminal allegations against me. She alleged that I molested my 1 year old daughter. Doctors, specialists, detectives and DCFS were all involved and a full blown investigation occurs. No evidence on my daughter of abuse. I was interrogated by detectives and they let me go immediately. DCFS considered the allegations unfounded. DCFS told me they are considering this a case of parental alienation on her part.

I'm getting to the point. Please bear with me.

I feel like I have a shot at getting custody of my kids. The only barrier between me and that is the kid's Guardian Ad Litem (a lawyer that the court appointed that I have to pay for at a rate of $400/hr). In December I had to pay him $1,000, and it'll probably be another $1,000 this month. Once I get all of the paperwork from DCFS, the other medical report, etc. I can present my case to him that my wife has attempted to alienate me from my kids on multiple occasions (something a judge would take very seriously in a custody case).

Because of these allegations, I felt like I needed time to formulate a battle plan. I can't afford a lawyer anymore (I make too much to qualify for a state lawyer), so I am going to have to represent myself (I have also looked into cheaper lawyers, but the most recent one I talked to decided not to represent me because she was concerned it could drag out for years). In order to get the case continued, I had to agree to pay temporary child support which is 28% of my paycheck ($1060/month).

I get the kids 2 1/2 days a week so I spend a good amount of time with them. In hind sight I would have argued to pay less child support since I'm already supporting them quite a bit by myself. But everything will be reevaluated in April.

The situation I'm in now is that my old lawyer that I owe $20,000 called me today and said pony up. They want $1,500/month for a whole year to pay it off. When you take into account the $1060/month I pay in child support, the $1050 I pay for rent, the $1000+ I have to pay the kids lawyer every month, I am left with around $800/month to pay for all of my other bills (car payment is $350- it's a lease that I can't get out of due to the car being worth less than what I owe, utilities, food, diapers, gas, train ticket for commuting, parking, etc. etc.) So I am having to rely on my side income now to make sure ends can meet. I am basically treading water right now.

So now this lawyer that I've racked up insane debt with called me today to let me know that they'll be taking me to court for the money. From looking around a bit and talking to people- it is likely that they'll win because I legitimately owe this money. In that case, my wages will probably be garnished giving me less to work with to take care of my kids.

I have no one left to borrow money from. I come from a very small family and I make the most out of all of my family members. I work day and night (main job and side job) and average around 3-5 hours of sleep per night. Is it bad form to ask the larger reddit community for financial help? Normally, it seems that they're more inclined to help the destitute (homeless or totally destroyed people)...in my case, I make a decent living, but (as Eminem put it) ""I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell."" She has told me she's going to drag this out and make it as expensive as possible for me. I don't know how she's affording her lawyer. She claims her lawyer has agreed to work for free. I can't see how that's possible.

**TL;DR- Wife left for another man, took my kids from me and fled 1200 miles away and I had to file divorce so she'd return them. She then made false criminal allegations against me. Now my ability to provide for my family is in serious jeopardy because I am $20,000 in debt to predatory lawyers that pounced when I was desperate to get my kids back. Is this something I should ask the larger reddit community for help with or is that bad form?**

692,249,"...after having not played it for maybe nine months.  Haven't played New Vegas, either- it didn't seem the same and I didn't want anything to taint the experiences I had with Fallout 3.

...anyway, just played Fallout 3 for the first time in 9 months, and...it's incredible.  I stopped playing because I felt I had done everything.  Haha!  Don't know what I was thinking.  It was hard to tell what areas I haven't discovered yet, because I got that perk long ago that reveals all the locations on the map, regardless of whether you've been there.  So I discovered I had only discovered perhaps 75% of the map after 59 hours.

I noticed I hadn't yet visited the Arlington Cemetary- because Fallout 3 takes place in DC, might as well do some sight-seeing, right?  And I avoid the Mall area a lot cause I think the Wasteland area is cooler.  So I've spent 60 hours in the Wasteland area, and as little as possible in maybe the fifth of the map that is the bottom right corner that contains the Mall (which is also much more densely populated by locations than the Wasteland).  So, since I don't like fast-traveling (and can't anyway, cause I haven't discovered the Arlington Cemetery) I walk instead, requiring me to go through the underground subway areas.  Requiring me to fight many Ghouls, with very low health (and not a bed in sight).  So I'm down to almost no health, and emerge closest to the Cemetery.  Swarmed with Super Mutants.  Can't teleport, cause there are enemies near by.  I could take them all out with my MIRV, but I'd been saving those eight shots for...well, I guess a situation like that.  But it's such a fun toy I didn't want to waste it in actual gameplay.  So instead I use the Stealthboy I'd been hoarding, pop a bunch of Med-X's, and make a break for it.  They somehow see me once I'm past them, and open fire.  I'm about to die, so I enter the closest location- a building called Hubris Comics.  I've played almost every mission, and never once had to go there.  So I did.  And it has a history.  That's what's fantastic about Fallout: the history.  I feel like an archeologist, learning the backstory from a Commodore 64 that sits on the counter and holds logs of the Comic Publisher's history.  Making connections.  A letter from a fan to the publisher, outraged about them corrupting her favorite comic villain, the AntAgonizer.  It was signed something like ""Oppressed in Oakton,"" and I thought, ""Hey!  I've been in Oakton!  There's a woman there who dressed up as an Ant-themed super-villain, who fought some other equally-disillusioned superhero!""  I would have never made that connection if I hadn't happened to walk into that one town by chance and exploration over a year ago, where I settled the endless dispute between the AntAgonizer roll-player and the person she was fighting.  But I did, and I remembered.  And I made that connection, and it was awesome.

So this started as a quest to the Arlington Cemetery, one of many locations I haven't been to.  I ended up learning amazing backstory to something that I probably very nearly forgot.  And you know what?  There's more in Hubris Comics; there are booby traps everywhere, and I'm gonna avoid all of them and find out who's behind them.  And then I'm gonna continue fighting my way towards the Arlington Cemetery, and probably get diverted by similar stories along the way.  But the amazing thing is, it's not forced upon you.  What are the odds that a player would discover the AntAgonizer in that one town, and settle the dispute, and then later discover Hubris Comics and read that terminal?  Not too high.  And the fact that I did means there are obviously many other instances like that out there- some I've found, some have yet to be found.  I could have walked into another place instead, and never have read that terminal.  But maybe I would have read another, and had a similar experience.

Off to bed- I do my best rants late at night.  Just sharing what a wonderful experience this game is- I will continue my quest to Arlington Cemetery (the purpose behind which is simply getting there- don't know what I'll do when I reach my goal), and hopefully find more immersive elements like this along the way.

TL;DR:

60 hours in, I'm still finding incredible stories hidden many layers deep in Fallout 3, and I continue to be amazed by the level of history they built in, along with the fact that the player is the one actively analyzing the history of the Fallout universe without the game intervening to help (if that makes sense).

P.S.,

For those who played New Vegas, does it offer this similar experience?  Or is it not as good?"

She's super quiet and I couldn't be happier with her performance. My budget going into the project was $1,500 and I'm right at about $1,300 right now with one more HDD to go. I'm not crazy about the neon green on my PSU, but it's not too noticeable. She boots up in about 45 seconds and as soon as icons are populated, I can click on them and start working; there is no need to wait for all the start-up programs to finish loading. Any navigation in Windows Explorer is instantaneous. I'm absolutely in love with my motherboard and she has 2 SATA3 slots, 2 USB 3.0 slots, room for 24GB of RAM, is ready for crossfire, and is ready for the hexcore CPUs...it's quite future-proof.

9188,97," Каждое украшение, созданное Сильвией Хенеган - настоящее произведение искусства. Ей посвящен один из 200 видеороликов серии ""Познакомьтесь с саентологом"" на сайте Церкви Саентологии www.scientology.org. 

 Коллекция ювелирных украшений Сильвии Петры Хенеган - это уникальные изделия ручной работы, выполненные в европейском стиле. Сильвия использует природные камни, жемчуг из пресноводных жемчужниц и все, что вдохновляет ее. 

 В своем видеоролике на сайте www.scientology.org Сильвия Хенеган рассказывает о том, как Саентология помогла ей преодолеть застенчивость и обрести смелость творить. 

 Хенеган выросла в Германии в семье профессиональных музыкантов. Ее родители были прихожанами Центра знаменитостей Церкви Саентологии в Дюссельдорфе и познакомили ее с технологией Рона Хаббарда, когда ей было 13 лет. 

 ""Я была очень творческой натурой. Постоянно что-то рисовала, лепила, занималась каллиграфией, играла на флейте, органе, кларнете и пела. Но я был ужасно застенчивой, - говорит Хенеган. - Саентология помогли мне обрести веру в себя и не беспокоиться о том, что другие могут думать обо мне."" 

 Обретенная уверенность в себе позволила Хенеган стать вокалистом одной из групп ее города. 

 ""До Саентологии я никому не могла показать, что я делаю,"" - говорит она. 

 Сильвия Хенеган и ее муж Джон живут в Клируотере (штат Флорида) с дочерью Леной и сыном Морицем. Раньше у Сильвии было кафе в этом городе, а затем она открыла ювелирную мастерскую, которая носит ее имя. Ее украшения выставлены в бутиках Клируотера и Майами. 

 Хенеган считает, что ее дом должен быть безопасным местом, где ее дети могут учиться и расти. Она привлекает их к работе по дому и к полноценному участию в жизни семьи. 

 ""Как-то раз Лена вернулась домой от своего друга и сказала: ""Мама, я люблю тебя."" Я, конечно же, тоже люблю ее, но я была удивлена, что она сказала мне это прямо с порога, - говорит Хенеган. - Я спросила ее, в чем дело, и она рассказала мне, что мать ее друга только что повела себя весьма неразумно и расстроилась без всяких на то оснований. И Лена вдруг поняла, что я никогда не веду себя так."" 

 Когда Лена рассказала ей об этом, Хенеган задумалась о том, насколько сильно Саентология изменила ее жизнь. 

""Если бы у меня не было инструментов, о которых я узнала в Саентологии, я уверена, что я бы выходила из себя без всякого повода, - говорит она. - Я даже не могу себе представить, на что была бы похожа жизнь без Саентологии.""

I had to go to town one day for a meeting in Wetherspoons, so I made the most of my time in the town and went for a haircut first before walking down to the pub.

I'd probably drink at any time of the day when in a pub that early in the day, but because I was meeting some business I ordered a coffee, who should be the bar maid but the girl I once knew as a kid.

We recognised each other and she came round the bar to give me a hug and kiss, there was really no reason why we had not spoken for a while so it was good to see her.

I asked how her father was as we used to play snooker in the local club together sometimes when they lived nearby, he was an old physics teacher who had stumbled upon a technique for doing something that had been worth some money, enough for him to retire when he sold the patents.

She told me he was in good health generally, but he was starting to lose his mind. The guy would be in his late seventies.

I thought back to the times we had played pool and he was one of the sharpest people I knew, so I was shocked by her news.

She told me he now speaks in a womans voice, or makes monkey noises sometimes when they talk. She had to sell the house he and his wife lived in to pay for the care.

It was then I remembered the story, once the house had been sold there was a piece in the paper about the new owner discovering an exquisite parquet floor under the carpet in the living room, and in the conservatory when the carpet was lifted they found satanic symbols etched into the stone, risen with human blood.

She showed me a piece of paper she had found, there was not much writing (but I photographed it with my BB), it simply had her fathers name and another name (which I won't write) underneath it, with the word 'Riches' marked in the corner."

8746,603,"As my cynicism evolves with age, I am becoming more and more put off by cinema, mainly because the vast majority of films out there are being produced, directed, and filled with the same people over and over again. They seem to be getting less and less original. We have this dinosaur industry raking in billions of dollars per year simply because they are the ones that can afford the big explosions and the big names, and unfortunately that is all that most people require from the movies now. It's like they're produced as filler material, mindless padding content to crank out into the theaters, just rehashing the same old story with a slightly less logical yet more predictable twist each time, with no replay value or actual significance. I posted this here and not in r/movies because I realized that this mindset stems from my strong DIY and antiestablishmenterianist belief that punk fostered and nourished inside of me, and I wanted to see how my fellow punks feel about the MPAA or their country's version of it.

This is not to say that there aren't good films being sponsored by the big money - I enjoy most of Tarantino's work, Scorcese, as well as a few others...I just kind of have this semi-hypocritical moral opposition to them for existing inside of a mindless, money-hungry industry.

We also know it isn't some kind of Naboo tradition for the Queen to speak in a funny voice, because in the third movie we get to see Amidala's successor to the throne, and she speaks in a normal voice.

The only thing I can think of is that it was part of her ""decoy"" routine, i.e. trying to make people believe that Queen Amidala and Padme Amidala were two different people. However, this seems stupid because a) what kind of democratically elected leader has a secret identity and b) how dumb would the people have to be to believe that the Queen's handmaiden just happens to have the same last name, and looks suspiciously similar?

9539,37,"I'm at my wit's end here. I've been to doctors, and none have ever been able to do anything that worked to fix my shin problems.

First, I don't know if I have shin splints, or stress fractures. But I've gotten them regularly for years. It's extremely frustrating, because I'm very active, and I enjoy running a lot.

After a decent run, my shins will typically be completely ruined for the next week or two. I'll be fine during the run, but the next day, sometimes it's hard to even walk. Any pressure on my shins is excruciatingly painful. Even pushing on my shin bone with my finger is painful. I've also noticed that sometimes even a short jog, the muscles on the fronts of my shins will cramp up painfully very easy.

It's been like this for years. I can't go on a decent run more often than every two weeks. I do a lot of cycling in between, and occasionally use an elliptical at the gym after lifting weights as well - low impact stuff, which doesn't cause problems. But it's very frustrating not being able to run regularly.

I've tried different shoes, I stretch my shin/calf muscle, I've wrapped my shins. Nothing has ever worked. Combine this with problems I've been having in both of my knees, and I often feel like a 50 year old when I'm only 26!

Anyone else experience chronic problems with their shins? Have you ever found relief? How? Any suggestions are welcomed... but if it's a common solution, chances are I've already tried it!

**The Argument from Moral Truth**

1. There exist objective moral truths. (Slavery and torture and genocide
are not just distasteful to us, but are actually wrong.)

2. These objective moral truths are not grounded in the way the world
is but, rather, in the way the world ought to be. (Consider: should
white supremacists succeed, taking over the world and eliminating
all who don’t meet their criteria for being existence-worthy, their
ideology still would be morally wrong. It would be true, in this
hideous counterfactual, that the world ought not to be the way that
they have made it.)

3. The world itself—the way it is, the laws of science that explain
why it is that way—cannot account for the way the world ought
to be.

4. The only way to account for morality is that God established morality
(from 2 and 3).

5. God exists.

*Flaw 1*: Premise 1) states that morality is objective.  In order to understand this argument we have to understand what the terms 'objective' and 'subjective' mean.

'Subjective' - Contingent on a mind (humor, beauty, value, etc.)

'Objective' - Not contingent on a mind (the moon, a car, a house, etc.)

The easy litmus test for is something is objective is to ask 'Does this exist if no minds are present?' Morality doesn't pass this under most conceptions of the universe.  Theism only adds an additional mind by placing the contingency of morality on God's mind rather than human minds.  Deferring moral judgement to an authority can be done to objectify something (""This is objectively against this authority's standards""), however the same can be done of any subjective (""This painting is ugly according to this authority"")

As such, the premise of objective morality is flawed. An easy counterexample: ""It may be considered morally wrong by humans to kill an innocent person, but the mind of a siberian tiger would think it a rather tasty and righteous proposition""

*Flaw 2*

Premise 2) is at best unprovable

*Flaw 3*

4) is an argument from a lack of imagination.

*comment*: We're tempted to say that morality is objective because we've been programmed by evolution towards specific subjective conclusions.  In the same way that we've been programmed to say that stealing is wrong (since this damages pack cohesiveness), we'd be tempted to say that rotten meat objectively smells bad (we've evolved it since it contains dangerous microbes and should avoid it) or that a phone book is objectively not hilarious (phone books don't play into the social construct of humor) even while accepting the premise that the pleasantness of smell and humor are subjective concepts."

###tl;dr: Need multiple throwaway Voice accounts for project; already exhausted my throwaway (landline) numbers would appreciate either donated throwaway accounts or PM'd phone numbers I could use to validate accounts.

---

Basically, I'm trying to create an open source SMS platform built on top of Google Voice.

Right now, I have a simple SMS service built in Python which uses one GV account to provide basic autoreply functionality as well as simple analytics and SMS-based credit card processing (via integration with [Hackswipe](http://hackswipe.com)'s backend).

However, there is a limitation in Google Voice which cuts off one account's SMS sending limit at 250/day, severely hampering the usability of what I've written.

Therefore, I plan to build on what I have, and create an enterprise system with RDBMS integration and more advanced functionality which incorporates a list of secondary Voice accounts to which sending can be offloaded once the primary account reaches capacity.

If anyone would be willing to create throwaway GV accounts for me to use with this project (preferably validated with a landline or other phone number you're unlikely to ever want to use with a personal production account), just post the username and password here (I recommend 'hunter2'). (The more, the better.)

Each time I bring up California, I can only think of words that are special to the west coast (dude, hella, etc.) but can only pinpoint 'Valley girl' , and that's it. Thoughts?"

Discuss why this sucks. Will tell you why when I come back.

ME: Screw it, the best thing about this site is being able to mess with complete strangers that you have a possibility of accidentally running into.

So I challenge you (yes you, random stranger I don't know) to have a creeper off. Yes, a creeper off. You game? The object of the game is to try to creep the other person out.

I'll start:

On a scale of 1 to 10, how nice are your toes?

HER: creeper off? i'm hiding in your bathroom with a... lol i don't know... giant hammer, waiting for you to come home :P

ME: How did you get in the bathroom? I can't even enter there without a gas mask what with all those decomposing hookers in the tub.

You must have a strong stomach.

HER: call 911...fell into toilet and stuck...plan backfired

ME: Stuck you say? There should be a paint can full of KY Jelly for just such an occasion right under the sink.

HER: ew you're nasty...

at this point a slightly panicked and got all apologetic

ME: Okay so I won then. (You agreed to play the game. No I don't ACTUALLY have dead hookers or a vat of KY Jelly)

HER: Oh bummer. I like the bad boys...like hooker killing bad.

ME: I only kill hookers if I have backup. You never know when things get dicey.

No response yet. She's online right now, so I sent an IM (no response yet)

I'm bored with this goofy game, and I want to meet up for drinks. What's your number lady? I'm Ethan by the way.

4025,361,"Preface: I'm 20. And not a pedophile.  Feel free to add rhyming verses or revisions to the original poem, or to just criticize my poetry. It'd be cool to have a legitimate poem in homage to such a strange Internet meme. 




Why cant you see?  
That this love can not be.  
Can any love be  
so taboo and bold,  
As the love between   
the young and the old?  
or any love  
as wrong and as dirty?  
as the love between  
fourteen and thirty?  




""No"",  
Say he.  
With a black beady stare,  
And a voice fitting, only for brown Pedobears.  
He then talked of some things that would sicken most men  
of the things he has done to girls over ten.  
I listen to each of his tales in disgust.  
of chasing lolitas and children in lust.  
How can live with yourself? I shout in dispair.  
He turns over to me without seaming to care  
he gave me a stare before giving advice.  
with malice and mischief beaming out of his eyes.   
""Such thinking is nonsense"". Says the grizzly bear stud.   
""If theres no grass on the lawn   
then I play in the mud"".  


... Your welcome to continue the poem from here..."

It lists everything he has accomplished in his first two years. If people could add to it as he accomplishes more, it will prove to be just what we need to show the many reasons we need him elected for a second term.

All of the accomplishments are listed by category and in the text of the posting itself. I ask people when they have an accomplishment to add, that they do so as a comment in that category and provide a reference. I will then check it out to make sure it is legit and then add it to the list permanently. I want to keep this list accurate, reliable and trustworthy. Any help would be appreciated over the next two years.

8410,733,"So, my aunt has Polycystic Kidney Disease. She's in the top 10 on the recipient's list for kidney donations. She's already rejected one from my father, I've gotten tested, but am not a match. But she's on the list, and we're getting closer. That is, until now.

So she has a secondary insurance. The kidney foundation has been paying for this secondary insurance for a while. Typically, the kidney foundation sends a check to my aunt. She deposits it, and writes a check to the insurance company. They obviously don't want to carry her, as she has an expensive condition.
So, this last time, some idiot at the Kidney Foundation accidentally sent the check directly to the insurance provider. The insurance provider held onto the check for a month, and sent it back to my aunt one day before the bill was due, saying they don't accept third party checks, and she needed to get a new check in in order for her insurance to not get canceled. Obviously, there wasn't enough time, and the insurance company canceled her policy.

She is on daily dialysis to keep her alive. The insurance paid for this. She obviously doesn't work. She was on the list for a kidney. IF she gets a call now, they won't be able to receive the kidney. Basically, this insurance company has sentenced her to death. What can we do? The kidney foundation screwed up, are they liable? What about the insurance company? I just don't know where to start. Thanks.

Making that kind of money, he could have gotten an apartment, bought a laptop + podcasting equipment then started making his dream a reality. Instead, he stayed making the easy money on the street. Shit, I would too if I wasn't scared of getting shot or stabbed out here in New Orleans.

Sure, I know this story makes us feel all warm and fuzzy, like we belong to something (reddit) that can change the world for the better, but I'm simply pointing out an interesting fact.

9795,279,"So, using the pokeradar, I'm trying to get a shiny growlithe. I follow all of the steps, but randomly the pokemon that appears won't be a growlithe. It will be in the fourth spot and the same kind of grass shaking as before, but sometimes it just doesn't work. The highest I can get is about 20 before it always seems to not work. 

Is is completely random whether the pokemon you're trying to get shows up or not? I haven't run out of the screen of the shaking grass, so that's not why. Also there was 4 grass shaking all of the times.

Sorry for people that don't know about this, it's just getting frustrating."
5758,360,"Threads or comments with an observational generalization are constantly met with a smug/smart-ass response calling the author out for using a generalization. Do they really think that the poster was making a claim that 100% of people do whatever it is he/she suggests. Most of the bitching comes from someone not knowing how to use terms like 'most' or 'often' instead of 'every' or 'always'. However, interpreting their poor choice of words as actually believing their generalization are 100% accurate without exception ultimately just makes the whiner look like the idiot.

Even in threads that are obviously an attempt at humor, there is some jackass that needs to correct the poster's political incorrectness by pointing out that ""all women are not bad drivers."" Yes, good point. There are some women that drive better than some men. Therefore every joke or reference made about how women drive should be stricken from our vocabulary and thought process. Unless it can be scientifically proven that 100% of women are worse drivers than 100% of men, it is offensive to suggest that ""women"" are worse drivers than ""men"".

Please try to recognize that not all of us have access to conduct Gallup Polls or expansive scientific studies to determine exactly what percentage of WoW players live in their parents' basement. If we use that observational generalization to make a point or attempt to be humorous, please spare me the smug, self-serving comment about how you own your own home, have a healthy family life, attend several charitable and social engagements on a weekly basis and still have 5 level 85 toons.

I'm sure someone will be a big enough smart ass to point out, ""Not all anti-generalization statements are bad. Some times people make ignorant generalizations that are not only offensive/hurtful, but incorrect."" Thank you.

I would hate to sit next to these people at a comedy club. (I know that the majority of the people that rant about others' use of generalizations laugh their ass off when someone they like makes a generalization or someone makes a generalization about something they agree on - but probably isn't scientifically accurate.)

TL;DR - Let's all just get over ourselves. It's probably funny.

A good symbiotic species who live inside people (they're a type of liquid) have a rogue who has not been good to their hosts.  The bad character is chased by a good character throughout space and they both eventually crash onto earth.

The story then follows the protagonist who has to find a host and communicate with him and then try to locate the bad guy.

8479,578,"Make no mistake, folks. This is not the Superbowl the NFL wanted. Why? Because it makes the league office look bad. We are facing a lockout/work stoppage and it's all because of money. Big money and the owners. One of the teams we have is publicly owned with open finances and the other is run by a family who goes against greedy owners all the time.

The main reason we will have a lockout is Jerry Jones. These stadiums don't pay for themselves, kids. Either the amount of revenue for the owners goes up, helping him pay for it or the revenue sharing system that makes the NFL great is forever broken and he can become the Yankees. Guess which he is rooting for?

In a time of excess and free spending, we have two teams who are fiscally responsible coming into a white elephant of a stadium. Both the Packers are Steelers philosophically pay their players fairly, respect the contracts and try to keep people in a similar salary range. They don't go out there and sign big money free agents. They develop their players and pay them fairly and reward them.

Now you see two teams on the biggest stage in the world, the Superbowl itself and no one will mention their fiscal responsibility. How they care about the health of the league and the revenue sharing deal that makes the NFL the best sport in the world. These teams have people running them who understand the history and the legacy of the NFL. 

Let's hope that some national media picks up on this leading up to the Superbowl and the lockout. Here we have a chance to listen to people from teams that do things the right way. Will they be heard? Will the media be complicit in helping the NFL get their way? Or will they point out that guys like Jerry Jones only care about themselves and no one else?"

7877,133,"                                    A Condescending Cat

Little Fancy Pants struts down the hallway with all of the elegance one would expect. Tail pointing up at the sky. Slight prance in the step. Head held up and cocked just a bit to the right. General look of disapproval at his surroundings. 
	
I sit drinking my coffee at the dinner table, eyeballing the feline. I shake off the arrogance that I am slathered with when Little Fancy Pants enters the room, and go back to my morning newspaper. It's the Monday edition. I'm trying to catch up on all of the local goings on that I missed out on over the weekend. Away on business. This is what I come home to.
	
I flip to F7 and try my damnedest not to peer over the top of the paper to see how Little Fancy Pants is conducting himself. I can't help it. Some urge inside my brain draws me to the sight. My eyes just barely cut across the horizon of the movie times and I catch a glimpse of Little Fancy Pants walking to the sliding glass door. 
	
I will not be modest about this. My home is surrounded by a majestic view from any window in the house. I have worked for it. I have put in the man hours traveling across the country. Across the world. I deserve it. I deserve to come home to all of this. But that cat...
	
But that cat! What has that cat ever done to deserve one second's worth of my vista's beauty? There he is. Sitting. Looking out over endless mountains and the winter's final snowfall. There he is watching. Unimpressed.
	
I grip my newspaper and shake it a bit and I cough loud enough to hopefully interrupt Little Fancy Pants's morning routine. Who am I kidding? He doesn't flinch. I go one step further. I shout “HA!” as loud as I can. He cranes his neck back as if to say in his best butler voice ""Mmmm yes?"" And I nod at him. I let him know it's my house. 
	
The kids are at school and the wife is out to the farmer's market buying overpriced organic fruits and vegetables. I'm fine with it. I don't mind much. But I know that she's also coming home with an overpriced bag of organic cat food. ""He's a member of the family too she says."" Member of the family my foot!
	
I've been reading my newspaper for about five minutes and I know Little Fancy Pants is still sitting at his perch in his unsatisfied way. Just dealing with the scenery. He doesn't care. He wants more. Well this is the best I can do right now and I'm pretty happy with it and all of my house guests and friends and family love it here! My Dad, who never approved of a thing in my life! Who hates my kids and loathes my wife! He loves this house and the view that comes with it! Where does this cat with a free ride into the lap of luxury itself... where does it get off!?
	
I am crunching the outer edges of the newspaper because I am finding it hard to contain my anger. I shake the newspaper as loud as I can because I want that cat to get away from the window because I know he's only looking out at the beauty to show me how mundane all of it is to him. I sit the paper down and notice he hasn't moved. Wonderful.
	
My coffee is still pretty hot and I reach over to place a death grip on my World's Greatest Dad mug. I lift it to my mouth with trembling hands all aquiver. I can feel the heat. I know it's still too hot to drink comfortably, but I don't care. I feel the heat rising. It's hot, but its heat isn't anywhere close to matching the temperature inside my body at this point. I'm boiling.
	
My clasp on the mug handle tightens and I can feel it crack if only a hair. On with it. In a wild burst the mug goes bottoms up and the coffee slams down my throat. I scald myself, but I don't feel it quite yet. I send the mug crashing down on the oaken table hard enough to leave an immediate ring. I pound down both of my fists and lean forward and let out something like a refreshing ""ahhhhhh!"" The cat sits still. I bring my right forearm up to my face and drag it forcefully across my mouth and mustache. A little coffee dribbles down my chin and I chuckle.
	
""You!"" I call. ""Up! Let's go!"" I scream at Little Fancy Pants while pointing my index finger in his direction. He continues to ignore me. I crumple up the entire entertainment section and walk to the kitchen. I spot the jar of flour. I open it up and scoop a little bit into my hands and slap them together. I figure it will have to do. I'm fresh out of rosin bags.
	
Little Fancy Pants watches the disgusting scenic tapestry spread out before him and probably thinks about how much nicer it would have been if we had a place in the French Alps. Too bad, Little Fancy Pants. 
	
I take the mound. I get the sign for a curve ball and  shake it off. Only the heater this time out, boys. I wind up. I kick. I deliver a missile made of movie times and musicals and pretentious reviews and the goddamn sunnuvabitch turns at the last second and swats it out of the air. He probably got a double. I get pissed.
	
""Ohhhh so you play ball, too?"" I shout across the room. He jumps over the couch and darts back down the hallway, so I give chase. As my feet pound the hardwood of my multi-million dollar home, I rip the shirt from my chest and send buttons click clacking all over the place. I'm screaming at the top of my lungs in some tribal language that hasn't been used for millennia.
	
I hear the front door open. It's my wife. Back from the farmer's market. I run upstairs to our bedroom and put on my bathrobe and grab my pipe and hightail it out to our upper level balcony to sit in the hot-tub. 
	
Little Fancy Pants is safe for now."

932,55,"Clearly, the current Big 12 seems to be at a breaking point. The conference no longer has a football championship game, it lacks a television network, it will become the smallest BCS conference, and it's traditional power school (Texas) didn't even make a bowl game this year. The conference does not share revenues equally, and schools from the old Big 8 seem to be clearly alienated from the rest of the conference besides OU and OSU which were clearly happy to be in the Big 12 South before. The Big Ten says it is done provoking expansion, but I recall the SEC quietly making a power move towards OU and Texas A&amp;M, which might incline the Big Ten and others to expand again. The PAC 10 clearly wanted to become the PAC 16 last summer, and there probably is still that desire. What do you guys think, tell me about your schools, and where they want to go."
8904,547,"Any Suikoden fans here? I am planning to build the castle/HQ from Suikoden 2. I'd be in SMP with no stuff like /give or anything, just me doing it all manually. If anyone is interested in helping, let me know. I need to design it out first.

10418,184,"So whenever I or my friend(s) suggest to do something with my female friends (not on a date) to see a movie/grab something to eat, there's always a 20-50% chance that when I call them that I'm on the way, they'll cancel. ""Oh I'm tired/I don't feel like doing that tonight."" I can understand that if I had invited them to something, that they were reticent to going in the first place, but what about when they do the inviting? 

""Hi, do you want to go do something? Oh that's great because I actually don't really want to."" ??

I can understand the situations when they cancel (one just finished the Susan G. Coleman walk for cancer, another was on her period), but in these instances, they did the inviting! Does the following thought appear in their head: ""Hey compstomper, do you want to go do X, with the implicit acknowledgment that there is a 20% chance that I'll cancel at the last minute""

It just seems like throughout the series there is a lot of Helo/Sharon and Baltar/Six overlapping.  From Baltar having Number Six's ""child"" and even seeing her before she's born.. who's actually Sharon's kid.. to Sharon helping Caprica Six realize her love for Baltar and later they save Hera.  

Also there seems to be some hostility between the two models.  Sharon shoots and kills a copy of Six on Cylon-Occupied Caprica to save Helo, the other Six seems to be a bit surprised and continues to call Sharon ""one of them"" as in human.  In Home pt. 2: *Baltar*: ""Boomer is going to bear... our child?"" *Six*: ""An honor for which she is hardly deserving. But o­ne doesn't question god's will.

1227,239,"The IAPAM leads its competitors in offering the most complete botox training and aesthetic medicine education in North America. In 2011, attendees at the IAPAM’s Aesthetic Medicine Symposium will have the competitive advantage of learning from board-certified dermatologists and experts in the fields of botox training, lasers and light devices, dermal fillers, hCG for weight loss, medical grade chemical peels and medical micordermabrasion. Beyond the hands-on botox training and aesthetic medicine instruction, the resources physicians receive from the IAPAM position it as the most respected physician training available.

Las Vegas, NV, January 05, 2011 -- The International Association for Physicians in Aesthetic Medicine’s (IAPAM) Aesthetic Medicine Symposium with botox training is different than any other educational program offered in North America.  The IAPAM offers comprehensive aesthetic medicine training and long term support for physicians of all medical specialties. The IAPAM is where the world’s physicians come together to learn and share their experiences in aesthetic medicine. The IAPAM offers a suite of aesthetic medicine training programs from botox training to hCG training, along with aesthetic practice business training.  Unlike programs offered by a private company, the Aesthetic Medicine Symposium is certified by the IAPAM, a voluntary professional association of physicians and supporters, which sets standards for the aesthetic medical profession. 
 
Attendees at the IAPAM’s Aesthetic Medicine Symposium (http://www.aestheticmedicinesymposium.com) receive significant value for money. The Symposium provides physicians with:
 
- dedicated instruction from board-certified dermatologists, who are true experts of the skin and cosmetic injectables. 
- hands-on practice in the best injection techniques. 
- delivery of the botox training at a medical practice, not in a hotel room. 
- an environment that does not allow exhibitors, giving doctors more time for education.  
- the opportunity to attend the Symposium’s Aesthetic Practice Startup Workshop (http://www.iapam.com/bootcamp.html), which is the only medical spa program highlighting the latest information on medspa business development and social media marketing as taught by Harvard Business School.  
- the unique opportunity to attend the full-day session on hCG and Medical Weight Management (http://www.aestheticmedicinesymposium.com/physician-hcg-weight-loss-training). This session will cover hCG for weight loss, prescription appetite suppressants, ketogenic diet based programs, meal replacement and B6/12 injections.
- a set of DVD’s from the Aesthetic Medicine Procedure Training series, which covers: Botox training, dermal filler training, and microdermabrasion training.
 
A preview of this training can be viewed on YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of-jMxVNLOY.
 
To date, over 750 physicians, as well as their accompanying medspa managers, registered nurses, and assistants, have attended the IAPAM’s weekend Aesthetic Medicine Symposiums and hCG Physician Training sessions, which offer physicians a unique educational experience in a resort location from a renowned faculty.   Join the hundreds of physicians who have the IAPAM Advantage!

398,500,"Comparison of two Epub e-book readers Aldiko vs Laputa


**Aldiko 1.2.14**

**Pros:**

* Can adjust background colour
* Shows accurate progress

**Cons:**

* Changing orientation (portrait / landscape) causes a lag and you end up on a different page!
* Horrible (for me) page sliding animation.
* Fiddly to import books (not hard, just fiddly).
* Less content providers for books download


**Laputa 3.0.6**

**Pros:**

* Changing orientation does not cause any problem with position on the book and is almost instantaneous.
* Nice page turning animation (leaf rolling)
* Easier to import books
* Many content providers (though some books on *Avayewn* and *Blazer* seem to be *bookz*!).

**Cons:**

* Buggy progress bar (on some books I converted from HTML).
* No background colour option.

**Pros on both:**

* Good choice of fonts and font sizes.
* Epubs on SD card support
* Move to SD support.
* Free

I like both but Laputa wins by a hair (keeping Aldiko though)."

3537,57,Dorwan Stoddard-Age 76. Died on Saturday in Tucson after jumping on his wife to shield her from bullets. Now that's love.
3406,24,"So several weeks ago, I hit it off with this grad student at a party – a sporty, short-haired HB6. We talked pretty much the whole time (which I might not have done if I was intentionally trying to pick her up, ironically), and I got the sense that I could definitely get her number/Fb, and possibly even take her home right then.

But I was in a pretty low-energy state that night (preoccupied by some other stuff going on in my life), so I didn't attempt either. (I figured I'd see her at another party with this group of friends eventually, so there was no need.) But then, when we were saying goodbye, she gave me this look that seemed to mean, ""So are you going to ask for my number or what?"" so I kind of half-heartedly did. 

Eventually I decide I want to go on a date and probably sleep with her. Which, despite my still being low-energy and not ""in state,"" totally happened.

But first, here's the PU theory I was thinking about. I don't think I applied most of it particularly well, but I'll let you be the judge.

* **Kino:** I get the sense that kino is really, really key, and this was totally missing from my natural/intuitive ""game"" and the few pickup materials I read before this community. So I thought of this as experiment #1 in using kino to help escalate things. 

* **Multiple locations:** The way I think about this is, the way we subjectively experience time has as lot do with the number of meaningful experiences, not the number of minutes elapsed. An hour spent at each of three locations probably will result in a lot more meaningful experiences than three hours (or four even) spent at any single one of them, and so it feels like more ""time,"" in the good-for-getting-laid sense. (Like, ""I've been hanging out with this guy long enough that I feel comfortable doing _____  now."") I forget who to credit for this idea, TofuTofu?

* **Be hot:** It had been awhile since I'd gotten a haircut, eyebrow waxing, etc. Partly because of this date, I went ahead and did both.

* **Push/pull:** I couldn't actually find an opportunity to do this – I think I need to be more high-energy for it – but I think this is key too. I'm dying for a chance to use TofuTofu's ""OMG I hate you...  *hug* Aww, I can't stay mad at you!!""

So here's how it went down. 

First, I suggest we go to an art museum on X day, and she's like, sure! So far, so good. Then, to slip in a second location, I suggest we meet at this particular café first, and again, she's down with it.

The day arrives, and we meet at the café. We catch up about how the holidays went, how her grad school program is going, and so on.

We head to the museum, and I remember that it's hard to talk at a museum. So I now have mixed feelings about museums as a first date activity. And since we weren't talking much, I felt like I needed to rely more on kino. So, for example, instead of just saying, ""I'm going to check out that room,"" I would touch her arm while I said it. But I'm new to this, and I think I was doing it too lightly, and I feel like it was almost counterproductive – kino that makes you seem timid is probably worse than no kino at all. 

(Then again, this ended in an f-close, so maybe mediocre kino is better than no kino at all.)

Eventually we leave, and now we're at the end of the pre-arranged date activities. I wasn't confident she'd agree to come back to my place yet, so I suggest we get a drink, and she agrees, with what sounds like a little ambivalence. So we head to a bar nearby, which is also pretty close to my house. 

And when we're there, she orders food, which I take as a sign that she's not in a hurry for the date to be over, despite her sort of mixed signals. More probably-too-timid kino. My conversational and body language game this whole time is not A+ but solid.

So finally, as we're leaving the bar, I ask if she wants to come over my place. She hesitates. I figure either I was too timid, or too direct, so I correct both by saying, ""Why don't you come over and have a cup of tea,"" more as a direction than a question – trying to be confident, but not make her feel like she had to decide that moment whether she was going to sleep with me later on. And she says OK.

From here it's just the home stretch. I don't think an immediate cavemanning would work, so I go the lame-but-reliable movie route, and from there the kino escalated fairly naturally, though still more awkwardly than normally. (Maybe it was her, not me?) When the movie ends we make out, I take her to my room, and the clothes come off, with no LMR. 

**Edit:** Oh, and the really awesome part – after some pretty great sex, she heads home (it's still kind of early), and says something to the effect of, ""I'll see you later... sorry, I don't mean to be presumptive."" Meaning, she wants to do this again, but isn't being the least bit clingy or U-Haul-y. Which. is. awesome.

**TL;DR** - First date where I tried to escalate kino, and it felt a bit awkard, but it all seemed to work out in the end.

8194,600,"I'm going to buy a new system, either a ps3 or an xbox.  I currently own a wii and its fine, but I want some more hardcore core gaming games.  The games I enjoy are puzzle games, adventure games, and platforming games, but I also like the better FPS and RPG games.  

What system should I get?  What are the essential games for each system?

For PS3 I know I'd want to get little big planet and stuff like god of war or assassin's creed.

For xbox, I'd probably get a halo game as well as the above that is also on xbox.  

FWIW, I find GTA-style sandbox games, sports games, and racing games just so-so. 

As far as I know, I'm not dying to get either xbox connect or ps3 Move, unless apparently I should be, but as far as I'm aware, meh.  

What's the head to head comparison? Which has better graphics? Which has better overall games?  Which is the better deal at this point?

As discussed in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/evy5q/this_subreddit_needs_more_pictures/), some people thought it was a good idea to have a weekly WAYWT as MFA needed more pictures and even a bit more personal touch. In this thread, feel free to post a picture per day. I thought it would be neat to start of Mondays with this. 

It's a good idea to

* **edit your first post with additional pictures**, and post as often as you like.
* include what the attire is for (some people are going to work, some to school, some are simply hanging out in suburbia)

Pictures are incredibly encouraged as it's quite tough to imagine what someone else is wearing without them.

**Critiquing others is welcome and encouraged, but keep it constructive/factual.** Take a lesson from Dale Carnegie's [How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People) if needed. It takes balls to post pictures of yourself on the Internet, the least you can do is accord the same courtesy as you would to someone in real life.

**DOs**

* I think this would look better with an oxford shoe
* I don't think that type of shirt is quite in fashion, have you considered somethign like *this*?
* That would look killer with a cardigan.

**DON'Ts**

* I think you dress like an obese WalMart enthusiast
* That shirt is ugly, so are you, you ugly, ugly man. Everything about you is ugly.

This is for anyone that wants to be part of a team atmosphere. There is no minumum requirement to tryout. If you're thinking of attending, please leave your bn character name and code, the race you play, and your bad-ass player slogan. 

_______

There will be two groups on the team; They will be the main team and a developmental team. The developmental team is meant to help find and develop less skilled players who have a lot of potential. There will be approximately 8 players in each group depending on how many people tryout. 

Tryouts will run every other day and last 4 weeks depending on the number of people who are interested. Most likely it will be 4 weeks though. That is a minimum of 14 tryouts before final cuts. Expect most practices to start at 9 PM EST and run for 2 hours. You don't need to make every practice, but if you can't make a particular practice, please let me know what's going on. 

The first round of cuts will be done after the second week of tryouts. If there are a lot of players, there will be a second round of cuts after four weeks, before the final cut is made. 


Also note that on one of the tryouts there will be free pizza and gloating on the line. Mmmmm pizza.... and gloating

Good luck and Have fun =)

2062,530,"From ye olde Wikipedia:  

Packer has advocated that LDS historians should refrain from discussing history that does not promote faith in the organization. In a 1981 speech to educators in the LDS Church Educational System, he cautioned them that ""There is a temptation for the writer or teacher of Church history to want to tell everything, whether it is worthy or faith promoting or not. Some things that are true are not very useful."" Arguing that teachers should ""give milk before meat"", he stated that ""some things are to be taught selectively and some things are to be given only to those who are worthy."" Packer's opinion applied to all historians who were members of the LDS Church: he stated, ""One who chooses to follow the tenets of his profession, regardless of how they may injure the Church or destroy the faith of those not ready for 'advanced history', is himself in spiritual jeopardy. If that one is a member of the Church, he has broken his covenants and will be held accountable.""

8285,136,"To many people, the New Year symbolizes a chance to start over and make new commitments to their health and wellness. It is a time of resolutions and strict dietary plans, when new memberships to fitness facilities are at an annual peak, and vows are renewed to abstain from eating fattening, processed and sugary foods. Regardless of all these intentions, many of these strict guidelines people create for themselves can be a challenge to follow on a long term basis. Here are 4 manageable tips to keep you in good health all year:


Drink Water

Since the average adults loses 10 cups of water every day through urine, breathing, sweating, and bowel movements, drinking water every day – especially first thing in the morning – helps prevent dehydration. Water is essential for good health, so replace what you are losing by drinking purified water throughout the day. Adding a squeeze of lemon juice to your daily cup of water can add benefits by helping to cleanse your system.


Reduce Refined Sugar

Besides causing your metabolism and insulin levels to fluctuate wildly, sugar depresses your immune system and promotes inflammation in the body. In addition, reducing sugar intake from foods and drinks such as white bread, sweets and soft drinks may actually increase your energy.


Get More Sleep

Try to get 8 hours of sleep every night. If you have trouble falling asleep, consider traditional herbs such as passionflower, hops and valerian. You may also want to consider supplementing with 5HTP, a precursor to serotonin production, which will improve your sleep patterns. Chronic sleep deprivation is detrimental to your health and has been linked to heart disease, diabetes and cancer, among other degenerative conditions.


Reduce Stress

Consider alternative therapies such as massage, homeopathy and acupuncture for stress relief, the treatment of chronic health issues or as preventative medicine. Many find significant relief by complementing their current regime with time-tested, traditional therapies. These modalities are holistic in nature, meaning they have the potential to address all aspects of your being – physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual.


Renewing your commitments to health and vibrancy does not mean you have to engaging in extreme adjustments. Making simpler choices that fit your lifestyle while also addressing your health needs will allow you to set the stage for achieving the resolutions and goals that inspire you this year, and for years to come.

Every contest needs prizes, so thanks to a couple of generous companies we can offer the following:

[**ThinkGeek**](http://thinkgeek.com) have donated a [**Korg Monotron**](http://www.thinkgeek.com/electronics/musical-instruments/e0db/) for the winner!

[**Grooveshark**](http://grooveshark.com) have donated **3 month VIP codes**! These are worth $27 each and we have a big list of them to award. Maybe enough for every entrant, depending on demand.

Finally, we have a few months of [**Reddit Gold**](/help/gold) to award to the finalists.

Sound interesting? These are the rules we have considered for the contest:

1. Entrants have one week to create an original song. 

2. This song must be hosted at either youtube or soundcloud.

3. To enter the competition, submissions should be PM'd to [user *RedditMusicContest*](/user/redditmusiccontest). Promoting or linking to your track prior to entry will result in disqualification.

4. All qualified entries will be posted in a voting thread in r/music.

5. The winner(s) will be decided by upvotes only.

There are a few other things we have been considering, and would like your feedback on whether they should be included:

* That songs should be to a theme.

* That genre subreddits could hold mini-contests, and winners go to a grand final.

If anyone else has any ideas, we'd love to hear them. This competition will begin within a week!

"
3310,595,"I had just got off a long, lonely shift at the store I work at, and was flying down the highway toward home. I get off at midnight on Sundays, so by the time I'm driving home the roads are pretty bare. The road I take home goes through a lot of rural/farmland areas, and a few smallish towns. (Yay, southern Illinois...) During most of the drive, the speed limit is around 45, but through the town areas and residential areas it drops down to 20-30. Usually, I just fly through, dropping my speed to 35 at the slowest, because there is never anyone else on the road, and I am always tired after a long shift, eager to get home to my husband. 

I was driving through a residential area, and for some reason I decided to turn off all my music. (Usually I blast some [Roger Clyne](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT6BTkWtc3E) and sing as loud as my terrible voice will let me, in an attempt to keep myself awake.) I wasn't getting any texts, so I was completely concentrated on driving. Interestingly enough, I was even abiding by the speed limit, due to the fact that people were leaving bars around this time. 

Out of nowhere, a black dog leapt out into the road in front of me. I managed to slam on my breaks; sending my purse, water bottle, and pizza flying into the dashboard. The dog stood in front of my car for a moment. It stared back at me as I stared at it, trying to catch my breath and regain my composure. With a flash of my high beams the dog hurried across the street and scampered off into the neighborhood adjacent the highway. 

I continued on my way, even more careful than I was before. My heart was still racing by the time I got home. It was incredibly lucky for both the dog, the family it belonged to, and I, that I'd chosen to drive home more carefully. If I had been speeding, checking a text message, singing loudly to my music, (Loud music is distracting, believe it or not.) talking on the phone, or fiddling with my mp3 player, I could have killed somebody's best friend. It really gave me a reality check, and made me realize how important focusing on the wheel is. Even if most of the time you might be okay switching a song, or sending a quick one word text, there might be that one time you're not, and that one time can make a world of a difference. 

**TL;DR, I almost killed a dog, and would have killed it if I was driving irresponsibly, (as a lot of people often do.) as I usually do late at night on the way home from work. Be careful when driving. You hear it all the time, but it really does matter.**"

7018,534,"You would think you wouldn't have to get into such elementary debates with people who subscribe to /r/atheism. Yet it happens time and time again. 

It will start when one of them says something like ""Yeah but we cannot know for sure God does not exist. We cannot act like opponents of religion.""

We cannot know anything for sure. We cannot know if I am really a human or skynet secretly surfing the internet. I myself cannot know if I am truly sitting in a chair. 

However, we are pretty certain about things we don't have evidence for. We cannot entertain religious ideas because of the infinitesimally small chance that God does exist. 

Then we'd have to put our human sacrifices for the angry unicorn monster every night. Then our biologists would have to search for sasquatch because of the possibility it might exist! Our scientists would have to waste thousands of dollars to study each and every haunted house. 

These agnostics, theists, and light-weight-'atheists' will make the argument that we only perceive a small amount of our world, so we cannot know for sure that God doesn't exist. 

A 2D creature, cannot know for sure 3D creatures do not exist. However, it can live life pretty certain that 3D creatures don't exist if it has not seen evidence for it or heard of evidence of them. Therefore, for it is correct for the 2D creature to assume there are no 3D creatures, until there is evidence for it. 

TL;DR: Stop making the first-cause argument and stop pretending that atheists convincing people there is no God because of lack of evidence, is the same or disrespectful as religious people convincing people there is a God in the absence of evidence.

6744,655,"Dwt, Wdrw, Active, and I played some Squad Rush on Vanilla tonight. Dwt and I adapted a tactic we used to use on HC Search and Destroy on the COD series. 

What we did is split our squad into two teams of two. Each team consists of a point man and a medic. The point man can be any class, but the medic would of course have to be a medic. 

The point man, like the name implies, takes point and goes in front. He will be the one that calls out the most directions and enemies because he will see them first most of the time. The medic stays behind the point man and works with him. The medic revives the point man when he goes down. The teams cross communicate for effectiveness.

I don't want it to seem like I'm saying that the point man is an ""officer"" or something like this, or that he makes all the decisions on where to go. He just goes in front. The team just always moves together on where they want to go.

The squad as a whole is constantly communicating with each other. They share any pertinent information with each other. For example, Squad Alpha sees enemies coming up on Squad Bravo's flank. Alpha would alert Bravo to them. Just like you would when you normally play.

The purpose of this tactic is that the squad can perform coordinated attacks. Alpha tells Bravo, ""We are about to plant. Get somewhere that you can provide overwatch."" Also, this tactic could be useful for one squad splitting their two teams up and attacking in a pincher movement through the flanks while the other squads attack up the middle.

I would like to try this in a regular Rush game. When we did this in Squad Rush tonight we were playing against one of TA's many nemeses, DOA. We never lost, winning 15 back to back rounds. They diffused maybe two of our plants and only planted on us once. They never captured one MCOMM. 

So guys, this has been tested and it *is* effective. But just how effective would it be in Rush mode? Thats what I want to find out. So what do you guys think about the idea and would you be willing to try it out?"

9526,632,"I grew up in a family that treated smoking marijuana as a horrible thing, even though they were very open about alcohol (which I think is infinitely more destructive). I've since done a lot of research on my own; I'm willing to do shrooms or ecstasy once every couple of months, and I'll smoke weed if somebody's offering it.

However, I'm having a hard time separating out what's real information and what's propoganda (both from straight-edges and drug advocates).

So my question is, exactly how bad are these drugs for you, really? Shrooms, Ecstasy, Cocaine and Heroin (which I'd never do anyway but I'm still curious about how much is hype and how much is actual terrible stuff), that sort of thing. I already know marijuana is virtually fine to smoke."

And in June 2008, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller described the conclusions of his committee's exhaustive report on the Bush administration's public statements regarding Iraq:

Before taking the country to war, this Administration owed it to the American people to give them a 100 percent accurate picture of the threat we faced. Unfortunately, our Committee has concluded that the Administration made significant claims that were not supported by the intelligence. In making the case for war, the Administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated, contradicted, or even non-existent. As a result, the American people were led to believe that the threat from Iraq was much greater than actually existed.
It is my belief that the Bush Administration was fixated on Iraq, and used the 9/11 attacks by al Qaeda as justification for overthrowing Saddam Hussein. To accomplish this, top Administration officials made repeated statements that falsely linked Iraq and al Qaeda as a single threat and insinuated that Iraq played a role in 9/11. Sadly, the Bush Administration led the nation into war under false pretenses.
There is no question we all relied on flawed intelligence. But, there is a fundamental difference between relying on incorrect intelligence and deliberately painting a picture to the American people that you know is not fully accurate.
 

It was, in short, a propaganda campaign. As former Press Secretary Scott McClellan wrote in hisrevelatory 2008 memoir, Bush's advisors ""decided to pursue a political propaganda campaign to sell the war to the American people.... A pro-war campaign might have been more acceptable had it been accompanied by a high level of candor and honesty, but it was not.""

And as Jonathan Landay wrote for Knight Ridder in 2005, the materials that had become public to date demonstrated ""that the White House followed a pattern of using questionable intelligence, even documents that turned out to be forgeries, to support its case -- often leaking classified information to receptive journalists -- and dismissing information that undermined the case for war.""

That's what made Patrick Fitzgerald's prosecution of the Valerie Plame case so essential. It promised a public view into the heart of the administration's dirty tricks department -- and a chance to find out once and for all who the mastermind was. But Cheney aide Scooter Libby's lies stymied Fitzgerald, and we never found out for sure -- even though the signs pointed pretty clearly to Libby's boss."

Quick recap of the details:
You [RSVP here](https://spreadsheets0.google.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;formkey=dGNvM2NlTFNMNGtKOF80QVhFLXlxOVE6MQ#gid=0), I will assign you a beer, you bring a six-pack of to the event, I will give a very brief intro to beer making and the ingredients, I will explain each style of beer brought one at a time followed by a sampling of that beer, we discuss what you thought of it, we move on to the next style.

Quick disclaimer of the details:
This is a beer sampling event, to improve your knowledge of different beer styles and hopefully, find a new beer you love. You probably won't get drunk, but please don't drive buzzed. 

Admission to the event is the six-pack of beer you are assigned as well as a $1 donation to the theater. I know I said it'd be free originally but $1 for a location is a sweet deal, **and** you will receive a coupon for $3 off to [American Burger Bar](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=American+Burger+Bar,+Wabasha+Street+North,+Saint+Paul,+MN&amp;aq=0&amp;sll=44.944936,-93.094711&amp;sspn=0.03809,0.104628&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=American+Burger+Bar,&amp;hnear=Wabasha+St+N,+St+Paul,+Minnesota&amp;z=16) which is next door. If you're too buzzed to drive, why not head over there and have some fries or something. Although, no one should scoff at the price of my event, as for the price of a sixer you'll get to sample a whole bunch of different beers!

If it's cool with Drifter and Grondin it might actually work out to have the weekly beer meet up at the American Burger Bar so people don't really have to choose between this or that event. And those that don't want to come to this, can just meet us there after. Thoughts?

4464,361,"After 8th grade a child would have the option of either attending a vocational school, (to learn an art or profession) or a pre-secondary interdisciplinary school(That prepares the child for college). Each school will have to create a unique selection process.Be it a standardized test, an essay, an interview, whatever. Having the choice to choose ones high school not only provides initiative to learn/study at an earlier age ,but also provides a much needed stratification when it comes to matching students with teachers. A better school, obviously, admits only studious, self motivated, fast learning students. As well as attracts ambitious hardworking teachers. These students that learn at a faster rate will no longer be slowed down to accommodate the less studious, slower learning students. Likewise, students that learn at a slower pace will be accommodated at a school with teachers that teach at a comfortable pace. The curriculum of each school would accommodate the learning speeds of its students. The option of vocational schools can lend students the option of specialization at an early age. Be it arts, architecture, carpentry, cooking, etc.
With such stratifications in quality and discipline, we realize the full potential of every student at the age they need it the most, and adequately prepare them for life.  
#  
**A general retort**:
It sounds as if you are highly underestimating the potential of a 13-14 year old. In Europe, (Hungary to be more specific). A student in 8th grade is very well educated. They know the geography, biology, mathematics, architecture, history, and literature that not even most AP-High school Juniors know.They are well read, and even before being stratified into post 8th grade schooling, well versed in most disciplines. They are at such an early age capable of making very difficult decisions. Not because they have a particular propensity towards working harder, understanding life better, or being smarter. But because they where raised in a system that promotes this characteristic early on in a child's development through similar stratification. If a high school becomes as selective as a college thats more initiative for a kid to prepare and study at an earlier age.  
But I do identify with what onmyfaceplease and ahoyhoy have to say.  
But can you not agree that Stratification works even in our current school system? Take IB, AP, Pre-AP, NHS,Honors and our GT(gifted and talented) programs. They instantly filter out a group of students motivated to do well in their studies. As opposed to the other students of the school, who's content with a slow paced curriculum, to plan or to pursue other disciplines(Ex:Art,Music,Sports).
Stratification of High schools can make focusing on interdisciplinary studies so much more efficient, provide(for the smartest of students) an level of education unparalleled by any public school in the United States.  
Eltzi and andanteambrosino also made a good point. 1st about the changes to infrastructure we would need. and geographic barriers to making this a reality. And 2nd, they way things work in New York City.  
About the geographic setbacks. You are correct. That is one monumental flaw in this system. I guess student housing would'nt be out of the question. 
You may get students from across the country situated with independent life at school housing.As for new york. Perhaps most of you are correct. And a schooling system like this is too detailed and complicated to be implemented on a scale larger than that found in Europe.

6463,43,"All government officers of the United States, including the President, the Justices of the Supreme Court, and all members of Congress, pledge first and foremost to uphold the Constitution. These oaths affirm that the rule of law is superior to the rule of any human leader.[23] At the same time, the federal government does have considerable discretion: the legislative branch is free to decide what statutes it will write, as long as it stays within its enumerated powers and respects the constitutionally protected rights of individuals. Likewise, the judicial branch has a degree of judicial discretion,[24] and the executive branch also has various discretionary powers including prosecutorial discretion.

Scholars continue to debate whether the U.S. Constitution adopted a particular interpretation of the ""rule of law,"" and if so, which one. For example, Law Professor John Harrison asserts that the word ""law"" in the Constitution is simply defined as that which is legally binding, rather than being ""defined by formal or substantive criteria,"" and therefore judges do not have discretion to decide that laws fail to satisfy such unwritten and vague criteria.[25] Law Professor Frederick Mark Gedicks disagrees, writing that Cicero, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and the framers of the U.S. Constitution believed that an unjust law was not really a law at all.[26]

James Wilson said during the Philadelphia Convention in 1787 that, ""Laws may be unjust, may be unwise, may be dangerous, may be destructive; and yet not be so unconstitutional as to justify the Judges in refusing to give them effect."" George Mason agreed that judges ""could declare an unconstitutional law void. But with regard to every law, however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as judges to give it a free course.""[27]"

The twist was that the aliens only used technically pacifist weapons, like bombs that made people forget what they were doing. Their ultimate weapon was one that made people have very strong feelings including depression and suicidal thoughts. The only people to make it to the alien fort was the Sergent and the new recruit. The Sergent then knocks the recruit out, barges into the fort, and blows up the aliens that resemble bunnies that only tremble and made no move to attack. 

It is very annoying to remember everything about the story except for the title and author.

2137,189,"I was having a Facebook conversation with someone over the health care reform bill. This person's position is that the bill ""forces individuals to purchase health insurance from private companies."" 
 
I haven't responded yet, but my immediate thought was this: 
 
The bill doesn't force anyone to do anything. It simply creates consequences for various actions. If you choose to not purchase insurance, you may be required to make a relatively small payment to the treasury. If you have insurance, you don't make that payment. You still have a choice. Similarly, if I purchase an electric car this year, I may get a tax credit up to $7,500. Conversely, if I don't buy an electric car, my tax bill may be $7,500 more than what it would be if I do. Using your logic, is the government ""forcing"" me to buy an electric car since a non-purchase would result in me having to pay more?

**How the players got here:**

The three 2010 GSL Open Tournaments were to increase interest in SC2 and to determine who the top players were based on repeat performance. [The points were tallied](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/GSL_Rankings) and players 1-32 were seeded into this Code-S tournament. Players 33-64 were seeded into the Code-A tournament.

**How the 2011 GSL Tournament works:**

The tournament workflow is [best described by this chart](http://i.imgur.com/Ev5Jc.jpg) (thanks to adremeaux/puzzl). Note that there is also a separate Code-A tournament which is not pictured. The Code-A tourney is a normal single elimination format with 32 players for January.


**A note on The Code-A Tourney:**

     Ro32 through Semis: Bo3
     Finals: Bo7

Players who make it to Ro16 will be seeded into next season's tournament. The rest have to go through the open preliminaries/qualifiers for Code A next season. Players who reach Ro8 will play in the ""up and down"" matches against the Code-S players. The top 2 players will get to choose their opponents from the pool of ""up and down"" matches.

**A note on Code-S Ro32 Group Stage:**

     Player A = Previously Ranked 1-8
     Player B and D = Previously Ranked 17-32
     Player C = Previously Ranked 9-16

     Match 1: Player A vs Player B
     Match 2: Player C vs Player D

     Winner of match 1 vs Loser of match 2
     Winner of match 2 vs Loser of match 1
     
Top 2 players advance into Ro16 and stay in Code-S for next season. Players with 2 losses are dropped to the up-and-down matches to determine their Code for next season (see the chart linked above).

* If two players are 2-0 and two are 0-2, each tied pair plays a tiebreak game. (6 games total)

* If the outcome is 2-0, 1-1, 1-1, 0-2, the tied players play for the tiebreak. (5 games total)

* If all four players are tied 1-1, the two pairs of players who haven't faced each other will play. The previous result between newly tied players is used as a tie-break. (6 games total)

This means that there will be no endless tiebreaks and no games where a player is playing for nothing, like with normal round-robin format. Every match will be an important rank-deciding match.

My girlfriend has a problem with doctors and is trying to manage her sleeping problems on her own will mixed results. 



Basically, she cannot shut her mind off and it snowballs from thoughts about things to thinking about not sleeping.  Then she gets frustrated which only compounds the problem.  It doesnt help that I instantly fall asleep every night and she has to watch me sleep well while she cant.  When she has brought it up to her doctor she is told that she should see a shrink which she doesnt want to do.  She also isnt a huge fan of medication, but that could also be because she has never found anything that really helped.  



This is not a chronic thing, but it more represents itself during periods of high stress, busy schedules, or just lots on her mind.  

What can I do to help?  What can she do to help herself?  What should she tell her doctor when she goes back to see him at my behest?




Tldr: Girlfriend cant sleep and I need to find out how to help"
5736,445,"I need advice on my performance review. This is my first year at this company and I have never filled out my own performance review. Basically I fill out the performance review and then my supervisor goes back and makes comments. How self-aggrandizing should I be? How honest should I be? From what other employees tell me, this is what they use to asses yearly raises.

Are there any HR and managers that have insight into the process? Anyone else have to go through this?

"
7148,208,"OK, so I was thinking about what to do for the next tournament, and here's the 2 things I think would be fun:

**A qualifier tournament**  Have smaller 8 man tournaments on 4 days.  Single elimination, 2 out of 3 matches, blah blah blah.  The 1st and 2nd place winners get a spot in the final tournament.  A person can enter multiple days, but new people will get spots first.  We could even use the in game tournament feature for the qualifying days.

The final 8 man tournament would be double elimination ran Evo style (the TO created a lobby, and invites the people who are playing their match).

or

**3v3 Tournament**  With it being a team tournament we can go with ""Single Elimination, 2 out of 3"" or ""Double Elimination, first team to win"" style to keep it from dragging on over weeks.


What do you guys think?  I'm trying to come up with ways to do tournaments but being able to run them quickly and efficiently.  Sadly, this would include me from running it on PS3 as I don't own that console.

P.S. I would also try streaming it.  I found my tri-pod and will look into setting it up so everyone can watch the matches when possible.  At the very least, if I'm hosting the lobby, I'll save every match so they can be recorded and uploaded at a later time to youtube."

9205,124,"I tried doing it once just to say I did, but I only made it to something like sixty listens before I felt like dying. The vague rules I had come up with were the following:

* I can listen to nothing but Flagpole Sitta and I must listen to it when I can.
* Every listen has to the scrobbled to prove authenticity. (My phone scrobbles on the go!)
* I have to turn off the music while I'm sleeping. Scrobbling plays while I'm asleep would make it far too easy.
* We could set some sort of quota of donations and every X dollars met afterwards would tack on an extra play of the song.

5401,99,"Late November, my friend needed money for an emergency that came up, and I loaned out $80 to help with expenses. I assumed I'd have it back in a few weeks, given that he was having regular business giving people tattoos, but it's mid January, and I haven't seen a penny. I've asked him several times what was up, and he claims he's good for the money, but always seems to have some bills to pay, or an unfortunate situation that leaves him broke. I've gone about it as nice as I can, but even though he'll occasionally assure me that I'll get my money, I'm tired of waiting. How do I do to make sure I get my money back?

**Before you say it, I know that lending money out is a bad habit. This is a rare occasion that I've done it, and not had it payed back quickly.**

It also occurred to me that his tattoo kit is probably worth close to $80, if not more. Would it be wrong of me to schedule an appointment, and then take the kit?

EDIT: It seems as though he has a few tattoo appointments... one this week and one next week. He's obviously making enough in those to pay me back, but considering he sucks with managing his finances, there is no way I'm going to take the full amount of profit from him, even if he owes me cash. He seems to be okay with $20 this week, and $20 next week. I guess that's a start. I'm also going to pick up the cash right as he gets it, so that he doesn't have time to lose the small portion of the total he's receiving. I figure he won't miss the $20 if it was only in his hand for a minute. "

5416,209,"I've never believed that these big sites are rigged or anything like that but what happened yesterday and today made me a bit wary, it's probably nothing but it's just too weird.

In a period of about 4 hours total it was impossible for me to make a hand. I played a bunch of tournaments in which I was always beaten by a two outer, If I went all in with kings or aces someone would make a smaller set or whatever ugly hand, I lost EVERY flip (ahead or behind). It was ridiculous, at least 6 times someone made a straight in an all-in showdown. Believe me, I'm not even mentioning some other weird hands, like the one I had a guy all in dominated on the flop and he made a runner-runner straight with his kicker.
The few times I had playable hands, flops wouldn't help me. What baffles me most about all this is the ridiculous amount of bad luck in many tables in such a short period of time. I'm still thinking about how can someone be this unlucky, its borderline crazy.

WTF can I do? I just don't wanna play anymore because I'm afraid I'll be this unlucky. "
1906,141,"A close look at Arkansas’ history of earthquakes and drilling reveals a shocking surge in quake frequency following advanced drilling. The number of quakes in 2010 nearly equals all of Arkansas’ quakes for the entire 20th century. The oil and gas industry denies any correlation, but the advent of hydrofracking followed by earthquakes is a story repeated across the nation.  It isn’t going to stop any time soon, either.  Fracking has gone global."

2. Turn off all the lights.

3. Turn on Carl Sagan's Cosmos series. (Protip: it's on Netflicks.)

4. Enjoy the mind blowing experience.


I once started to fall asleep and ended up in a sort of in-between state where I could hear every word he was saying but I lost awareness of my surroundings and started having a dream quality representation of every word he was saying, like he was narrating my dream. I don't remember much anymore but it was definitely one of the best dreams I've ever had. I fall asleep almost every night watching the series now."

Man goes into bar, stops giant jar of 10 dollar bills, asks ""How can i get that money""
Bar man says ""It's a challenge, you put in 10 bucks, you win, you get all the money""
The man puts in his 10 dollars and asks for his challenges,
""First, drink this bottle of peper tequila, next there is a pitbull outside with a sore tooth, you must put it right, third there is a 90 year old woman up stairs who hasn't had an orgasm in her life, you have to set that straight""
The man drinks the tequila and endures great pain. He goes outside to help the dog, everyone hears yelping, screaming, and howls. The man comes back inside covered in cuts and scratches. 
""Well now, where was that that 90 old woman with the hurt tooth?"" 
Kind of lame i know...but whatever."
